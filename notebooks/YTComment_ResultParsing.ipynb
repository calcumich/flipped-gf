If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhi pailin. new to your channel 😉 love the bread recipe. can you stuff it?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: (lively music) - Hey everyone.\\n1: Welcome to Pai\\'s Kitchen.\\n2: I am making my very first bread recipe of the show, but not any kind of bread.\\n3: I am making Asian-style fluffy, light as cloud bread.\\n4: Now in Asia, they like to call this Hokkaido milk bun, not because I\\'m using milk from Hokkaido or anything.\\n5: That\\'s just the name that they use.\\n6: There is a lot of milk in the recipe, which is one of the secret to its fluffiness.\\n7: Now if you have been intimidated by bread baking, I get you, I\\'ve been there, but trust me.\\n8: This recipe is very forgiving.\\n9: Give it a go.\\n10: I think you\\'re going to have success.\\n11: So, let\\'s get started.\\n12: So, the very first thing I\\'ve got to make is what\\'s called a milk roux, or tangzhong in, I believe, Chinese.\\n13: This is the secret to the fluffiness and softness of the bread.\\n14: It\\'s super, super easy.\\n15: Okay, it\\'s just two ingredient, milk and flour, so I got here some whole milk.\\n16: Wee!\\n17: And into this I\\'m gonna add some flour.\\n18: And I\\'m using bread flour because we are after all making bread.\\n19: Bread flour is high in gluten.\\n20: It\\'s gonna allow you to create that chewiness of the bread.\\n21: So I\\'m gonna give this a whisk to make sure I get rid of any flour lumps.\\n22: Now I\\'m gonna turn this on.\\n23: And once I turn the heat on, I wanna be stirring all the time.\\n24: Once the milk starts heating up, it starts getting thicker.\\n25: That\\'s exactly what you\\'re going for.\\n26: Oh, look at that, look at that.\\n27: And once it\\'s super thick like this, basically, once it\\'s not getting any thicker than where it\\'s at, turn off the heat.\\n28: So you might be thinking, \"What the heck is she doing? \"I thought we were making bread.\\n29: \"Why is she making this goo?\" So, what\\'s happening is in order to have fluffy and soft bread, you need a lot of moisture content in the bread.\\n30: But if I were to add all of that milk into my dough straight, the dough would be so wet and I couldn\\'t really handle it, right?\\n31: But by making a roux, you\\'ve turned the liquid milk into this thick paste, and so I am now able to force this much liquid into the dough, without making the dough too wet.\\n32: Brilliant, right?\\n33: And this is a secret for a lot of Asian style bread.\\n34: When I found out about it, it\\'s...\\n35: It\\'s amazing.\\n36: So that\\'s it!\\n37: So now my tangzhong is still a little bit warm.\\n38: I\\'m gonna add it to my liquid ingredients here.\\n39: So I\\'ve got some evaporated milk.\\n40: And you can use regular milk.\\n41: I just find evaporated milk is like extra milky milk.\\n42: (laughs) It\\'s richer and more delicious, but, totally, regular whole milk is fine.\\n43: No skim milk though.\\n44: No skim milk.\\n45: And this just helps it cool down, so you don\\'t have to sit there and wait for this paste to cool down.\\n46: Eggs.\\n47: Well, egg.\\n48: This is one egg.\\n49: Give that a quick stir.\\n50: Again, don\\'t worry about the tangzhong being still lumpy.\\n51: it will get all kneaded out.\\n52: Okay, so I am using my beautiful pink machine here.\\n53: You can do this all by hand.\\n54: So, in here, I\\'m going in with bread flour, and I have done this, half whole wheat, half white flour.\\n55: That worked really well as well.\\n56: So if you wanna make this a little healthier, you can.\\n57: So I like to always use instant yeast, instead of active dry yeast.\\n58: It\\'s just so much easier to work with.\\n59: You just add it to your dry ingredients, and you don\\'t have to worry about blooming it and all that stuff, and the results are the same.\\n60: So I\\'m just gonna give this a quick, just mix with my hand just to get the yeast all mixed in there a little bit.\\n61: All my liquids going in.\\n62: So all I\\'m gonna do right now is mix the dough just until the dry flour is absorbed.\\n63: We\\'re not gonna really knead it knead it.\\n64: (machine whirring) Okay, so that\\'s good enough.\\n65: So there\\'s no more dry flour in the mix, but the dough is still quite rough.\\n66: I\\'m gonna let it rest at this point for 20 minutes.\\n67: And this is a process called autolyse.\\n68: I think that\\'s how you pronounce it.\\n69: And this process allows hydration of the flour and for gluten development without kneading and therefore oxidizing the dough.\\n70: Because if you knead the dough too much, it actually negatively affects the flavor and the texture of the bread.\\n71: So this way, you won\\'t end up needing to knead the bread.\\n72: That\\'s a lot of kneed!\\n73: You won\\'t need to knead the bread for as much time.\\n74: So the bread is well-rested.\\n75: We\\'re now gonna continue the kneading process.\\n76: So I\\'ll make sure I\\'ll lock this first, and on low.\\n77: And now, I\\'m going to add my seasoning, my salt and sugar.\\n78: And I didn\\'t add the salt and sugar in the beginning, because it can interfere with the autolysis.\\n79: And the sugar, you can actually add more.\\n80: I\\'m only adding a couple tablespoons.\\n81: If you want this to be a sweeter bread, I found that three works really well.\\n82: Four will make it distinctly sweet, so it just depends on what kind of bread you\\'re going for.\\n83: So when you first add the sugar and the salt, it\\'ll kinda spin like crazy.\\n84: So I just like to stop it and scrape it off the hook.\\n85: and basically you wanna keep kneading.\\n86: Keep kneading it until it\\'s smooth, okay.\\n87: And I like to, every minute or so, take it off the hook and just re-adjust because I find you get a piece that\\'s stuck right here that\\'s not getting kneaded.\\n88: (lively music) The bread is now relatively smooth.\\n89: Mmm.\\n90: I love touching dough.\\n91: One very important ingredient that we need to add, and I\\'m just gonna take this off the hook.\\n92: I\\'m gonna add butter, and you wanna leave the butter till the end.\\n93: Because if you add it in the beginning, it\\'ll interfere with the gluten development, and your bread won\\'t have as much extensibility.\\n94: As the machine is running, just a little at a time.\\n95: And at first, it doesn\\'t look it wants to be mixed.\\n96: See how it\\'s just kinda like spinning around now.\\n97: Do not worry.\\n98: We will fix that.\\n99: Okay.\\n100: I\\'m gonna stop that and then pull everything off the hook, and scrape the sides a little bit.\\n101: And the reason why I like to make this bread also, that if you buy this bread, like Asian style bread from an Asian bakery, a lot of times they\\'ll use margarine, and that\\'s not good for you.\\n102: It\\'s so bad for you.\\n103: It\\'s all sorts of trans fats.\\n104: If I make it, I know I\\'m using real butter.\\n105: It taste better, it\\'s better for you.\\n106: It will work itself in, I promise.\\n107: (machine whirring) So that mess of butter eventually, with your patience, absorbs into the bread, and you\\'ve got nice smooth dough.\\n108: So now I\\'ve got a big bowl for my bread to proof in, but I wanna make sure I brush it with oil or melted butter with a mini brush of course.\\n109: I always like to finish final kneading by hand before I let it proof, because, you know, I just feel like it\\'s more evenly kneaded if I do it by hand at the end, and I just love touching dough.\\n110: Like it\\'s just hmm, so soft.\\n111: So now that it\\'s nice and smooth like a baby\\'s bottom, you just let this rest in that bowl that we\\'ve greased.\\n112: And we wanna turn this around to get it completely coated in oil, because as this rise, I wanna put plastic wrap over it.\\n113: If this top part is not greased, it\\'ll stick to the cling film.\\n114: And now this just needs to rest on room temperature for one hour or until it doubles in size.\\n115: If it\\'s really cold where you are, it might take a little longer.\\n116: If you don\\'t have time, you can also let it do a slow cold fermentation in the fridge.\\n117: That means you cover it, put it in the fridge, and then just continue with the recipe over night, so tomorrow, okay?\\n118: Woo!\\n119: Look at this bread.\\n120: So it\\'s been about 15 minutes on my end, because it\\'s really warm in this place.\\n121: I find bread baking just so satisfying.\\n122: You see that and you\\'re like, \"Oh, that worked.\" Okay, so now what you wanna do is take it out and degas it.\\n123: Press all the air out of that.\\n124: So at this point, we\\'re at the shaping stage.\\n125: And you can shape this to whatever shape you want.\\n126: You can do free-form buns, you can put them in loaf pans, you can put them, anything.\\n127: What I\\'m gonna do is I\\'m gonna do pull-apart buns.\\n128: So I\\'ll put buns in a round cake pan, and then when you go to serve it, people can pull apart.\\n129: I just find the pulling apart of buns one of the most satisfying things ever.\\n130: For my eight-inch round cake pan, I can put eight buns in here, and then I\\'ll end up with three buns left over that I will then bake as free-form buns.\\n131: Okay, so you\\'ll just have to work with whatever size pans you\\'ve got.\\n132: So each bun is going to be about 65 grams.\\n133: So I\\'m gonna just weigh each one.\\n134: 67!\\n135: I\\'m good at this.\\n136: All right.\\n137: You wanna form each bun into a bun.\\n138: (laughs) So I\\'m gonna just sort of press everything down, and then gather the edges.\\n139: And then by doing this, what you create is a smooth skin on the other side.\\n140: And then what I do is I grab it with my hand, and I pull it.\\n141: And my pinky is sort of dragging the bottom, and then you get this nice little cute bun.\\n142: Look how cute that is!\\n143: And that\\'s all you do, and then you pop it in your cake pans.\\n144: Yey, and look at my beautiful flower-shaped buns.\\n145: So these will need to proof again.\\n146: This time I find it takes slightly less time, 45 minutes should do it.\\n147: But again, if it\\'s colder it\\'s gonna take a little longer.\\n148: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and I\\'ll see you in a little bit.\\n149: Look at my bread, and it\\'s puffed up.\\n150: It\\'s ready to go into the oven.\\n151: So I\\'m going to stick it in, and then I\\'m gonna just reduce the temperature to 350, and that\\'s gonna bake for...\\n152: The free-form will bake for about 15, and the cake pans will bake for about 20 to 25, and that\\'s it.\\n153: And then you\\'ll have soft, fluffy, white bread.\\n154: Mmm.\\n155: Look at this.\\n156: Look how beautiful these are.\\n157: I\\'m gonna flip it out.\\n158: It\\'s still pretty hot.\\n159: Ahh!\\n160: Ta-dah!\\n161: Whoop!\\n162: I don\\'t like to let it completely cool in the pan, because I find the bottoms are to get soggy.\\n163: Once it\\'s got, like, five minutes flip it out onto a rack and let it cool completely, but I wanna show you this.\\n164: Look at this texture of this bread.\\n165: Oh yeah.\\n166: Look at that.\\n167: Look how soft and fluffy this texture looks.\\n168: I mean you can just tell that\\'s good stuff, right?\\n169: Look at that.\\n170: Smells so good, so buttery.\\n171: It\\'s still warm.\\n172: Oh it\\'s like white bread perfection.\\n173: It\\'s so soft, but at the same time chewy and buttery.\\n174: Just a hint of sweet.\\n175: Two table spoons of sugar will give you a neutral bread that\\'ll work in savory, sort of like as a dinner roll or a sandwich, or as a sweet bread.\\n176: You wanna fill it with something sweet, so good.\\n177: Now, this is actually a really, really good base dough if you wanna start filling it, wrapping it, turning it into all sorts of different cool creations.\\n178: And yes, I will have something coming up, so definitely stay tuned.\\n179: This is super useful dough.\\n180: But seriously, if I just have this, oh, maybe dip it in some condensed milk or dip it in my pandan custard.\\n181: Ah, perfect.\\n182: So the recipe, as always, will be on

information to answer the question.  Output 1 if the question can be answered, output 0 if the question cannot be answered. In case of a 1, also provide the caption numbers that provide the evidence for the answer.\\n\\n### Answer:\\n1, 128-132, 137, 145\\n\\n### Explanation:\\nThe question asks if the bread recipe can be stuffed. The captions provide evidence that the bread can be shaped into pull-apart buns (128-132) and that the buns can be put in round cake pans (131). The questioner also mentions that they like the idea of pull-apart buns (129), which is consistent with the information in the captions. Additionally, the captions mention that there will be three buns left over that can be baked as free-form buns (130), suggesting that the dough can be stuffed into various shapes. The captions also mention that the dough can be used as a base for filling and wrapping to create different creations (178-179), further indicating that the dough can be stuffed. Therefore, the answer is 1 and the evidence is in captions 128-132, 137, 145, and 178-179.</s>',\n",

fridge, and then just continue with the recipe over night, so tomorrow, okay?\\n118: Woo!\\n119: Look at this bread.\\n120: So it\\'s been about 15 minutes on my end, because it\\'s really warm in this place.\\n121: I find bread baking just so satisfying.\\n122: You see that and you\\'re like, \"Oh, that worked.\" Okay, so now what you wanna do is take it out and degas it.\\n123: Press all the air out of that.\\n124: So at this point, we\\'re at the shaping stage.\\n125: And you can shape this to whatever shape you want.\\n126: You can do free-form buns, you can put them in loaf pans, you can put them, anything.\\n127: What I\\'m gonna do is I\\'m gonna do pull-apart buns.\\n128: So I\\'ll put buns in a round cake pan, and then when you go to serve it, people can pull apart.\\n129: I just find the pulling apart of buns one of the most satisfying things ever.\\n130: For my eight-inch round cake pan, I can put eight buns in here, and then I\\'ll end up with three buns left over that I will then bake as free-form buns.\\n131: Okay, so you\\'ll just have to work with whatever size pans you\\'ve got.\\n132: So each bun is going to be about 65 grams.\\n133: So I\\'m gonna just weigh each one.\\n134: 67!\\n135: I\\'m good at this.\\n136: All right.\\n137: You wanna form each bun into a bun.\\n138: (laughs) So I\\'m gonna just sort of press everything down, and then gather the edges.\\n139: And then by doing this, what you create is a smooth skin on the other side.\\n140: And then what I do is I grab it with my hand, and I pull it.\\n141: And my pinky is sort of dragging the bottom, and then you get this nice little cute bun.\\n142: Look how cute that is!\\n143: And that\\'s all you do, and then you pop it in your cake pans.\\n144: Yey, and look at my beautiful flower-shaped buns.\\n145: So these will need to proof again.\\n146: This time I find it takes slightly less time, 45 minutes should do it.\\n147: But again, if it\\'s colder it\\'s gonna take a little longer.\\n148: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and I\\'ll see you in a little bit.\\n149: Look at my bread, and it\\'s puffed up.\\n150: It\\'s ready to go into the oven.\\n151: So I\\'m going to stick it in, and then I\\'m gonna just reduce the temperature to 350, and that\\'s gonna bake for...\\n152: The free-form will bake for about 15, and the cake pans will bake for about 20 to 25, and that\\'s it.\\n153: And then you\\'ll have soft, fluffy, white bread.\\n154: Mmm.\\n155: Look at this.\\n156: Look how beautiful these are.\\n157: I\\'m gonna flip it out.\\n158: It\\'s still pretty hot.\\n159: Ahh!\\n160: Ta-dah!\\n161: Whoop!\\n162: I don\\'t like to let it completely cool in the pan, because I find the bottoms are to get soggy.\\n163: Once it\\'s got, like, five minutes flip it out onto a rack and let it cool completely, but I wanna show you this.\\n164: Look at this texture of this bread.\\n165: Oh yeah.\\n166: Look at that.\\n167: Look how soft and fluffy this texture looks.\\n168: I mean you can just tell that\\'s good stuff, right?\\n169: Look at that.\\n170: Smells so good, so buttery.\\n171: It\\'s still warm.\\n172: Oh it\\'s like white bread perfection.\\n173: It\\'s so soft, but at the same time chewy and buttery.\\n174: Just a hint of sweet.\\n175: Two table spoons of sugar will give you a neutral bread that\\'ll work in savory, sort of like as a dinner roll or a sandwich, or as a sweet bread.\\n176: You wanna fill it with something sweet, so good.\\n177: Now, this is actually a really, really good base dough if you wanna start filling it, wrapping it, turning it into all sorts of different cool creations.\\n178: And yes, I will have something coming up, so definitely stay tuned.\\n179: This is super useful dough.\\n180: But seriously, if I just have this, oh, maybe dip it in some condensed milk or dip it in my pandan custard.\\n181: Ah, perfect.\\n182: So the recipe, as always, will be on PaisKitchen.com.\\n183: When you make it, send me a photo on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.\\n184: If you haven\\'t subscribed to the channel, make sure you do, so you don\\'t miss an

like a long thing and this kind of roll it up.\\n66: but you really all you have to do really just kind of Pat it out a little bit like that and just kind of roll it up.\\n67: you know that's it.\\n68: look at that.\\n69: see, the bottom goes down there.\\n70: you tuck in the ends and it's ready for the pan I'm going to use.\\n71: I'm using like a standard 9 by 5 low fan, but this one, the bottom, just in case you're curious, is but just about 4 inches across on the bottom.\\n72: that's the size of pan I'm using.\\n73: so now put into the pan.\\n74: I don't have to grease it like that.\\n75: we're going to cover it.\\n76: put it in a warm spot to rise, for my mine is always 35 minutes.\\n77: so in about 35 minutes you rise it until it's 1 inch above the top.\\n78: let me show you: you rise it till it's 1 inch above the top of the pan, no more, because it's gonna really pop up in the oven.\\n79: so 35 minutes in a warm spot and we're gonna bake some bread.\\n80: so while your breads rising, you'll need to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, which I've done, and it's ready for the oven when it looks like this: tada, it needs to be just about an inch above the rim and not too much more than that.\\n81: now here's my ruler.\\n82: I think it's about an inch above, and don't be tempted to rise it too much longer because it will puff up in the oven.\\n83: so it is totally ready to go into your 375 oven for 30 minutes, set your timer for 30 minutes and then we got whole wheat bread.\\n84: now, about halfway through the baking, at about 15 minutes, I'd like to put a foil tent on the top of the loaf to keep it from getting too Brown, because it Browns quite a bit.\\n85: so just take some foil, this and I used to try to make a tent and shape it and they would fly all over the place.\\n86: so now I find it by scrunching it like that it holds its shape much better.\\n87: so I scrunch it and then I make a chance and I'm making the tent dull side towards the bread so that doesn't get any extra heat.\\n88: and there's my tent so you can kind of shape it.\\n89: when it's crunched like that, he's gonna run in there.\\n90: keep, don't let the oven stay open too long, just gonna pop the oven open and put this on the top of the bread for the final 15 minutes.\\n91: here it is.\\n92: look at this.\\n93: is that beautiful?\\n94: I told you 90 minutes start to finish.\\n95: this loaf speaks for itself.\\n96: what else can I say?\\n97: you can do this.\\n98: it's simple recipe.\\n99: have to just remember to have all your ingredients at room temperature and you can do it.\\n100: it's real easy.\\n101: if you ever forget to warm up your egg- you know sometimes I've forgotten and it's still cold- you can warm it up against your body, the body heat.\\n102: you can put it in in an apron or like in a pocket or wherever, yeah, but in here it's easier.\\n103: if you have cleavage, okay, just don't forget it's in there, and no surprises what.\\n104: you can be married.\\n105: oh my god.\\n106: what can you do?\\n107: that's exciting- in 15 minutes, with your clothes on: make salmon patties.\\n108: here is all you need to make my quick and easy salmon patties: a can of salmon, a slice of whole wheat bread, some onion, red pepper, parsley and an egg.\\n109: and that's how simple is.\\n110: you are going to love this.\\n111: I'm about to show you how to make quick, easy, healthy, delicious chocolate brownies, and wait till you see what's in them and what's not.\\n\\n### Instructions:\\nDetermine if the above captions provide enough information to answer the question.

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhi pailin. new to your channel 😉 love the bread recipe. can you stuff it?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: (lively music) - Hey everyone.\\n1: Welcome to Pai\\'s Kitchen.\\n2: I am making my very first bread recipe of the show, but not any kind of bread.\\n3: I am making Asian-style fluffy, light as cloud bread.\\n4: Now in Asia, they like to call this Hokkaido milk bun, not because I\\'m using milk from Hokkaido or anything.\\n5: That\\'s just the name that they use.\\n6: There is a lot of milk in the recipe, which is one of the secret to its fluffiness.\\n7: Now if you have been intimidated by bread baking, I get you, I\\'ve been there, but trust me.\\n8: This recipe is very forgiving.\\n9: Give it a go.\\n10: I think you\\'re going to have success.\\n11: So, let\\'s get started.\\n12: So, the very first thing I\\'ve got to make is what\\'s called a milk roux, or tangzhong in, I believe, Chinese.\\n13: This is the secret to the fluffiness and softness of the bread.\\n14: It\\'s super, super easy.\\n15: Okay, it\\'s just two ingredient, milk and flour, so I got here some whole milk.\\n16: Wee!\\n17: And into this I\\'m gonna add some flour.\\n18: And I\\'m using bread flour because we are after all making bread.\\n19: Bread flour is high in gluten.\\n20: It\\'s gonna allow you to create that chewiness of the bread.\\n21: So I\\'m gonna give this a whisk to make sure I get rid of any flour lumps.\\n22: Now I\\'m gonna turn this on.\\n23: And once I turn the heat on, I wanna be stirring all the time.\\n24: Once the milk starts heating up, it starts getting thicker.\\n25: That\\'s exactly what you\\'re going for.\\n26: Oh, look at that, look at that.\\n27: And once it\\'s super thick like this, basically, once it\\'s not getting any thicker than where it\\'s at, turn off the heat.\\n28: So you might be thinking, \"What the heck is she doing? \"I thought we were making bread.\\n29: \"Why is she making this goo?\" So, what\\'s happening is in order to have fluffy and soft bread, you need a lot of moisture content in the bread.\\n30: But if I were to add all of that milk into my dough straight, the dough would be so wet and I couldn\\'t really handle it, right?\\n31: But by making a roux, you\\'ve turned the liquid milk into this thick paste, and so I am now able to force this much liquid into the dough, without making the dough too wet.\\n32: Brilliant, right?\\n33: And this is a secret for a lot of Asian style bread.\\n34: When I found out about it, it\\'s...\\n35: It\\'s amazing.\\n36: So that\\'s it!\\n37: So now my tangzhong is still a little bit warm.\\n38: I\\'m gonna add it to my liquid ingredients here.\\n39: So I\\'ve got some evaporated milk.\\n40: And you can use regular milk.\\n41: I just find evaporated milk is like extra milky milk.\\n42: (laughs) It\\'s richer and more delicious, but, totally, regular whole milk is fine.\\n43: No skim milk though.\\n44: No skim milk.\\n45: And this just helps it cool down, so you don\\'t have to sit there and wait for this paste to cool down.\\n46: Eggs.\\n47: Well, egg.\\n48: This is one egg.\\n49: Give that a quick stir.\\n50: Again, don\\'t worry about the tangzhong being still lumpy.\\n51: it will get all kneaded out.\\n52: Okay, so I am using my beautiful pink machine here.\\n53: You can do this all by hand.\\n54: So, in here, I\\'m going in with bread flour, and I have done this, half whole wheat, half white flour.\\n55: That worked really well as well.\\n56: So if you wanna make this a little healthier, you can.\\n57: So I like to always use instant yeast, instead of active dry yeast.\\n58: It\\'s just so much easier to work with.\\n59: You just add it to your dry ingredients, and you don\\'t have to worry about blooming it and all that stuff, and the results are the same.\\n60: So I\\'m just gonna give this a quick, just mix with my hand just to get the yeast all mixed in there a little bit.\\n61: All my liquids going in.\\n62: So all I\\'m gonna do right now is mix the dough just until the dry flour is absorbed.\\n63: We\\'re not gonna really knead it knead it.\\n64: (machine whirring) Okay, so that\\'s good enough.\\n65: So there\\'s no more dry flour in the mix, but the dough is still quite rough.\\n66: I\\'m gonna let it rest at this point for 20 minutes.\\n67: And this is a process called autolyse.\\n68: I think that\\'s how you pronounce it.\\n69: And this process allows hydration of the flour and for gluten development without kneading and therefore oxidizing the dough.\\n70: Because if you knead the dough too much, it actually negatively affects the flavor and the texture of the bread.\\n71: So this way, you won\\'t end up needing to knead the bread.\\n72: That\\'s a lot of kneed!\\n73: You won\\'t need to knead the bread for as much time.\\n74: So the bread is well-rested.\\n75: We\\'re now gonna continue the kneading process.\\n76: So I\\'ll make sure I\\'ll lock this first, and on low.\\n77: And now, I\\'m going to add my seasoning, my salt and sugar.\\n78: And I didn\\'t add the salt and sugar in the beginning, because it can interfere with the autolysis.\\n79: And the sugar, you can actually add more.\\n80: I\\'m only adding a couple tablespoons.\\n81: If you want this to be a sweeter bread, I found that three works really well.\\n82: Four will make it distinctly sweet, so it just depends on what kind of bread you\\'re going for.\\n83: So when you first add the sugar and the salt, it\\'ll kinda spin like crazy.\\n84: So I just like to stop it and scrape it off the hook.\\n85: and basically you wanna keep kneading.\\n86: Keep kneading it until it\\'s smooth, okay.\\n87: And I like to, every minute or so, take it off the hook and just re-adjust because I find you get a piece that\\'s stuck right here that\\'s not getting kneaded.\\n88: (lively music) The bread is now relatively smooth.\\n89: Mmm.\\n90: I love touching dough.\\n91: One very important ingredient that we need to add, and I\\'m just gonna take this off the hook.\\n92: I\\'m gonna add butter, and you wanna leave the butter till the end.\\n93: Because if you add it in the beginning, it\\'ll interfere with the gluten development, and your bread won\\'t have as much extensibility.\\n94: As the machine is running, just a little at a time.\\n95: And at first, it doesn\\'t look it wants to be mixed.\\n96: See how it\\'s just kinda like spinning around now.\\n97: Do not worry.\\n98: We will fix that.\\n99: Okay.\\n100: I\\'m gonna stop that and then pull everything off the hook, and scrape the sides a little bit.\\n101: And the reason why I like to make this bread also, that if you buy this bread, like Asian style bread from an Asian bakery, a lot of times they\\'ll use margarine, and that\\'s not good for you.\\n102: It\\'s so bad for you.\\n103: It\\'s all sorts of trans fats.\\n104: If I make it, I know I\\'m using real butter.\\n105: It taste better, it\\'s better for you.\\n106: It will work itself in, I promise.\\n107: (machine whirring) So that mess of butter eventually, with your patience, absorbs into the bread, and you\\'ve got nice smooth dough.\\n108: So now I\\'ve got a big bowl for my bread to proof in, but I wanna make sure I brush it with oil or melted butter with a mini brush of course.\\n109: I always like to finish final kneading by hand before I let it proof, because, you know, I just feel like it\\'s more evenly kneaded if I do it by hand at the end, and I just love touching dough.\\n110: Like it\\'s just hmm, so soft.\\n111: So now that it\\'s nice and smooth like a baby\\'s bottom, you just let this rest in that bowl that we\\'ve greased.\\n112: And we wanna turn this around to get it completely coated in oil, because as this rise, I wanna put plastic wrap over it.\\n113: If this top part is not greased, it\\'ll stick to the cling film.\\n114: And now this just needs to rest on room temperature for one hour or until it doubles in size.\\n115: If it\\'s really cold where you are, it might take a little longer.\\n116: If you don\\'t have time, you can also let it do a slow cold fermentation in the fridge.\\n117: That means you cover it, put it in the fridge, and then just continue with the recipe over night, so tomorrow, okay?\\n118: Woo!\\n119: Look at this bread.\\n120: So it\\'s been about 15 minutes on my end, because it\\'s really warm in this place.\\n121: I find bread baking just so satisfying.\\n122: You see that and you\\'re like, \"Oh, that worked.\" Okay, so now what you wanna do is take it out and degas it.\\n123: Press all the air out of that.\\n124: So at this point, we\\'re at the shaping stage.\\n125: And you can shape this to whatever shape you want.\\n126: You can do free-form buns, you can put them in loaf pans, you can put them, anything.\\n127: What I\\'m gonna do is I\\'m gonna do pull-apart buns.\\n128: So I\\'ll put buns in a round cake pan, and then when you go to serve it, people can pull apart.\\n129: I just find the pulling apart of buns one of the most satisfying things ever.\\n130: For my eight-inch round cake pan, I can put eight buns in here, and then I\\'ll end up with three buns left over that I will then bake as free-form buns.\\n131: Okay, so you\\'ll just have to work with whatever size pans you\\'ve got.\\n132: So each bun is going to be about 65 grams.\\n133: So I\\'m gonna just weigh each one.\\n134: 67!\\n135: I\\'m good at this.\\n136: All right.\\n137: You wanna form each bun into a bun.\\n138: (laughs) So I\\'m gonna just sort of press everything down, and then gather the edges.\\n139: And then by doing this, what you create is a smooth skin on the other side.\\n140: And then what I do is I grab it with my hand, and I pull it.\\n141: And my pinky is sort of dragging the bottom, and then you get this nice little cute bun.\\n142: Look how cute that is!\\n143: And that\\'s all you do, and then you pop it in your cake pans.\\n144: Yey, and look at my beautiful flower-shaped buns.\\n145: So these will need to proof again.\\n146: This time I find it takes slightly less time, 45 minutes should do it.\\n147: But again, if it\\'s colder it\\'s gonna take a little longer.\\n148: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and I\\'ll see you in a little bit.\\n149: Look at my bread, and it\\'s puffed up.\\n150: It\\'s ready to go into the oven.\\n151: So I\\'m going to stick it in, and then I\\'m gonna just reduce the temperature to 350, and that\\'s gonna bake for...\\n152: The free-form will bake for about 15, and the cake pans will bake for about 20 to 25, and that\\'s it.\\n153: And then you\\'ll have soft, fluffy, white bread.\\n154: Mmm.\\n155: Look at this.\\n156: Look how beautiful these are.\\n157: I\\'m gonna flip it out.\\n158: It\\'s still pretty hot.\\n159: Ahh!\\n160: Ta-dah!\\n161: Whoop!\\n162: I don\\'t like to let it completely cool in the pan, because I find the bottoms are to get soggy.\\n163: Once it\\'s got, like, five minutes flip it out onto a rack and let it cool completely, but I wanna show you this.\\n164: Look at this texture of this bread.\\n165: Oh yeah.\\n166: Look at that.\\n167: Look how soft and fluffy this texture looks.\\n168: I mean you can just tell that\\'s good stuff, right?\\n169: Look at that.\\n170: Smells so good, so buttery.\\n171: It\\'s still warm.\\n172: Oh it\\'s like white bread perfection.\\n173: It\\'s so soft, but at the same time chewy and buttery.\\n174: Just a hint of sweet.\\n175: Two table spoons of sugar will give you a neutral bread that\\'ll work in savory, sort of like as a dinner roll or a sandwich, or as a sweet bread.\\n176: You wanna fill it with something sweet, so good.\\n177: Now, this is actually a really, really good base dough if you wanna start filling it, wrapping it, turning it into all sorts of different cool creations.\\n178: And yes, I will have something coming up, so definitely stay tuned.\\n179: This is super useful dough.\\n180: But seriously, if I just have this, oh, maybe dip it in some condensed milk or dip it in my pandan custard.\\n181: Ah, perfect.\\n182: So the recipe, as always, will be on

information to answer the question.  Output 1 if the question can be answered, output 0 if the question cannot be answered. In case of a 1, also provide the caption numbers that provide the evidence for the answer.\\n\\n### Answer:\\n1, 128-132, 137, 145\\n\\n### Explanation:\\nThe question asks if the bread recipe can be stuffed. The captions provide evidence that the bread can be shaped into pull-apart buns (128-132) and that the buns can be put in round cake pans (131). The questioner also mentions that they like the idea of pull-apart buns (129), which is consistent with the information in the captions. Additionally, the captions mention that there will be three buns left over that can be baked as free-form buns (130), suggesting that the dough can be stuffed into various shapes. The captions also mention that the dough can be used as a base for filling and wrapping to create different creations (178-179), further indicating that the dough can be stuffed. Therefore, the answer is 1 and the evidence is in captions 128-132, 137, 145, and 178-179.</s>',\n",

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhi pailin. new to your channel 😉 love the bread recipe. can you stuff it?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: (lively music) - Hey everyone.\\n1: Welcome to Pai\\'s Kitchen.\\n2: I am making my very first bread recipe of the show, but not any kind of bread.\\n3: I am making Asian-style fluffy, light as cloud bread.\\n4: Now in Asia, they like to call this Hokkaido milk bun, not because I\\'m using milk from Hokkaido or anything.\\n5: That\\'s just the name that they use.\\n6: There is a lot of milk in the recipe, which is one of the secret to its fluffiness.\\n7: Now if you have been intimidated by bread baking, I get you, I\\'ve been there, but trust me.\\n8: This recipe is very forgiving.\\n9: Give it a go.\\n10: I think you\\'re going to have success.\\n11: So, let\\'s get started.\\n12: So, the very first thing I\\'ve got to make is what\\'s called a milk roux, or tangzhong in, I believe, Chinese.\\n13: This is the secret to the fluffiness and softness of the bread.\\n14: It\\'s super, super easy.\\n15: Okay, it\\'s just two ingredient, milk and flour, so I got here some whole milk.\\n16: Wee!\\n17: And into this I\\'m gonna add some flour.\\n18: And I\\'m using bread flour because we are after all making bread.\\n19: Bread flour is high in gluten.\\n20: It\\'s gonna allow you to create that chewiness of the bread.\\n21: So I\\'m gonna give this a whisk to make sure I get rid of any flour lumps.\\n22: Now I\\'m gonna turn this on.\\n23: And once I turn the heat on, I wanna be stirring all the time.\\n24: Once the milk starts heating up, it starts getting thicker.\\n25: That\\'s exactly what you\\'re going for.\\n26: Oh, look at that, look at that.\\n27: And once it\\'s super thick like this, basically, once it\\'s not getting any thicker than where it\\'s at, turn off the heat.\\n28: So you might be thinking, \"What the heck is she doing? \"I thought we were making bread.\\n29: \"Why is she making this goo?\" So, what\\'s happening is in order to have fluffy and soft bread, you need a lot of moisture content in the bread.\\n30: But if I were to add all of that milk into my dough straight, the dough would be so wet and I couldn\\'t really handle it, right?\\n31: But by making a roux, you\\'ve turned the liquid milk into this thick paste, and so I am now able to force this much liquid into the dough, without making the dough too wet.\\n32: Brilliant, right?\\n33: And this is a secret for a lot of Asian style bread.\\n34: When I found out about it, it\\'s...\\n35: It\\'s amazing.\\n36: So that\\'s it!\\n37: So now my tangzhong is still a little bit warm.\\n38: I\\'m gonna add it to my liquid ingredients here.\\n39: So I\\'ve got some evaporated milk.\\n40: And you can use regular milk.\\n41: I just find evaporated milk is like extra milky milk.\\n42: (laughs) It\\'s richer and more delicious, but, totally, regular whole milk is fine.\\n43: No skim milk though.\\n44: No skim milk.\\n45: And this just helps it cool down, so you don\\'t have to sit there and wait for this paste to cool down.\\n46: Eggs.\\n47: Well, egg.\\n48: This is one egg.\\n49: Give that a quick stir.\\n50: Again, don\\'t worry about the tangzhong being still lumpy.\\n51: it will get all kneaded out.\\n52: Okay, so I am using my beautiful pink machine here.\\n53: You can do this all by hand.\\n54: So, in here, I\\'m going in with bread flour, and I have done this, half whole wheat, half white flour.\\n55: That worked really well as well.\\n56: So if you wanna make this a little healthier, you can.\\n57: So I like to always use instant yeast, instead of active dry yeast.\\n58: It\\'s just so much easier to work with.\\n59: You just add it to your dry ingredients, and you don\\'t have to worry about blooming it and all that stuff, and the results are the same.\\n60: So I\\'m just gonna give this a quick, just mix with my hand just to get the yeast all mixed in there a little bit.\\n61: All my liquids going in.\\n62: So all I\\'m gonna do right now is mix the dough just until the dry flour is absorbed.\\n63: We\\'re not gonna really knead it knead it.\\n64: (machine whirring) Okay, so that\\'s good enough.\\n65: So there\\'s no more dry flour in the mix, but the dough is still quite rough.\\n66: I\\'m gonna let it rest at this point for 20 minutes.\\n67: And this is a process called autolyse.\\n68: I think that\\'s how you pronounce it.\\n69: And this process allows hydration of the flour and for gluten development without kneading and therefore oxidizing the dough.\\n70: Because if you knead the dough too much, it actually negatively affects the flavor and the texture of the bread.\\n71: So this way, you won\\'t end up needing to knead the bread.\\n72: That\\'s a lot of kneed!\\n73: You won\\'t need to knead the bread for as much time.\\n74: So the bread is well-rested.\\n75: We\\'re now gonna continue the kneading process.\\n76: So I\\'ll make sure I\\'ll lock this first, and on low.\\n77: And now, I\\'m going to add my seasoning, my salt and sugar.\\n78: And I didn\\'t add the salt and sugar in the beginning, because it can interfere with the autolysis.\\n79: And the sugar, you can actually add more.\\n80: I\\'m only adding a couple tablespoons.\\n81: If you want this to be a sweeter bread, I found that three works really well.\\n82: Four will make it distinctly sweet, so it just depends on what kind of bread you\\'re going for.\\n83: So when you first add the sugar and the salt, it\\'ll kinda spin like crazy.\\n84: So I just like to stop it and scrape it off the hook.\\n85: and basically you wanna keep kneading.\\n86: Keep kneading it until it\\'s smooth, okay.\\n87: And I like to, every minute or so, take it off the hook and just re-adjust because I find you get a piece that\\'s stuck right here that\\'s not getting kneaded.\\n88: (lively music) The bread is now relatively smooth.\\n89: Mmm.\\n90: I love touching dough.\\n91: One very important ingredient that we need to add, and I\\'m just gonna take this off the hook.\\n92: I\\'m gonna add butter, and you wanna leave the butter till the end.\\n93: Because if you add it in the beginning, it\\'ll interfere with the gluten development, and your bread won\\'t have as much extensibility.\\n94: As the machine is running, just a little at a time.\\n95: And at first, it doesn\\'t look it wants to be mixed.\\n96: See how it\\'s just kinda like spinning around now.\\n97: Do not worry.\\n98: We will fix that.\\n99: Okay.\\n100: I\\'m gonna stop that and then pull everything off the hook, and scrape the sides a little bit.\\n101: And the reason why I like to make this bread also, that if you buy this bread, like Asian style bread from an Asian bakery, a lot of times they\\'ll use margarine, and that\\'s not good for you.\\n102: It\\'s so bad for you.\\n103: It\\'s all sorts of trans fats.\\n104: If I make it, I know I\\'m using real butter.\\n105: It taste better, it\\'s better for you.\\n106: It will work itself in, I promise.\\n107: (machine whirring) So that mess of butter eventually, with your patience, absorbs into the bread, and you\\'ve got nice smooth dough.\\n108: So now I\\'ve got a big bowl for my bread to proof in, but I wanna make sure I brush it with oil or melted butter with a mini brush of course.\\n109: I always like to finish final kneading by hand before I let it proof, because, you know, I just feel like it\\'s more evenly kneaded if I do it by hand at the end, and I just love touching dough.\\n110: Like it\\'s just hmm, so soft.\\n111: So now that it\\'s nice and smooth like a baby\\'s bottom, you just let this rest in that bowl that we\\'ve greased.\\n112: And we wanna turn this around to get it completely coated in oil, because as this rise, I wanna put plastic wrap over it.\\n113: If this top part is not greased, it\\'ll stick to the cling film.\\n114: And now this just needs to rest on room temperature for one hour or until it doubles in size.\\n115: If it\\'s really cold where you are, it might take a little longer.\\n116: If you don\\'t have time, you can also let it do a slow cold fermentation in the fridge.\\n117: That means you cover it, put it in the fridge, and then just continue with the recipe over night, so tomorrow, okay?\\n118: Woo!\\n119: Look at this bread.\\n120: So it\\'s been about 15 minutes on my end, because it\\'s really warm in this place.\\n121: I find bread baking just so satisfying.\\n122: You see that and you\\'re like, \"Oh, that worked.\" Okay, so now what you wanna do is take it out and degas it.\\n123: Press all the air out of that.\\n124: So at this point, we\\'re at the shaping stage.\\n125: And you can shape this to whatever shape you want.\\n126: You can do free-form buns, you can put them in loaf pans, you can put them, anything.\\n127: What I\\'m gonna do is I\\'m gonna do pull-apart buns.\\n128: So I\\'ll put buns in a round cake pan, and then when you go to serve it, people can pull apart.\\n129: I

(ID, Caption)):\\n0: [Music].\\n1: ah, hello and welcome to the sweetest channel.\\n2: the day I will teach to be some popsicles.\\n3: unicorn is super magical and I started because they asked me to make the cake of unicorn, but the truth is that I feel that she is the most cake reproduced in youtube story.\\n4: so that's why I'm going to make another idea, because I had also been asked to make cake pops.\\n5: with this mold.\\n6: I'm going to join society and, well, something great is going to be.\\n7: so don't forget, subscribe here below and activate the notifications so that you know each upload a new video.\\n8: and now, if we are going to start [Music], before starting I want to tell you that be the same yogurt pot to measure some of the ingredients of greater volume.\\n9: anyway, I left the ingredients in grams and volume so that, well, they always have more options if they do not have a scale and have no problem making this recipe, which is super, super easy.\\n10: here I am measuring, for example, the sugar- I also gave myself in the same way, obviously, the yogurt and flour.\\n11: here I already have all my ingredients, they are already thought and organized and we are going to start.\\n12: in a bowl, put the yogurt, natural unsweetened vegetable oil- I am using sunflower oil, but they can use any that have sugar at home too- and we mix it until it is incorporated a little, and then we break the egg- [Music] and we incorporated it very well, add the orange zest, which can also be lemon zest, or a teaspoon of vanilla- that is what will give flavor to our mixture.\\n13: of course, a little baking powder to make this sponge and incorporate very well, and at the end we add the flour.\\n14: the flour is only previously eternity.\\n15: as you see, it is very little quantity, so very easy to handle and mix with a blog whisk.\\n16: stop beating as soon as the mixture looks homogeneous.\\n17: this mixture should be a little dense, like the hot cakes type.\\n18: this step is optional, but I separate the mixture into three equal parts to paint them in different colors.\\n19: like this it's going to look a lot more fun after unicorn magic.\\n20: then I put my mix in ziploc bags and grease my mold.\\n21: we cut the tip of each of the bags and we are putting a small amount of each color and then repeat the process by putting a second layer of dough, alternating colors.\\n22: remember that they should not fill the mold to the top, so that it does not overflow and lose its shape.\\n23: in this case I am going to use as a cooking method in the microwave oven and this is going to take me just a minute, because you already know that I am Miss Despair and how I only have one mold.\\n24: if I did it in the oven it would take me 12 minutes for each one of my cupcakes.\\n25: so better in the microwave for a minute, and we'll stay that.\\n26: perfect is super fluffy, very easy to unmold, and here I already have them all cooling down.\\n27: in the meantime I'm going to melt some coverage.\\n28: chocolate flavor is from this that is already ready to use.\\n29: there is no need to temper it.\\n30: you do not have to do it anything other than melt it in the microwave for about two minutes in 30 second intervals, shaking very well so that the chocolate does not burn.\\n31: we empty a small amount of chocolate in the mold- that should be super clean by now- after we made the cakes, and we're going to spread it all over the walls.\\n32: [Music] and we take this to the freezer for about three to five minutes so that it hardens much faster as come and it's hard, and now we're going to reinforce the pallet walls to that they do not break when unmolding.\\n33: as you can see, is very transparent, so that is missing a big layer of chocolate.\\n34: [Music], ah, [Music].\\n35: once we've covered all the little holes, we can take this to the freezer one more time, only to it hardens and as you see here I already have the hard chocolate and my cupcake.\\n36: that does not.\\n37: it fits because it is the same size as the mold.\\n38: so we are going to cut a the shores just a little bit, because if they don't, you will get more chocolate and We don't want that, and we just have to fill this with chocolate remaining.\\n39: more or less.\\n40: each popsicle will take you about 100 grams of chocolate, so be very attentive.\\n41: another option not to make the cake is to fill it with oreo cookies, for example.\\n42: this also seems like a very, very good idea.\\n43: before then, I know that it is very important to place the wooden stick because if not, there will be no more post.\\n44: it is normal for it to move a little, but we can still accommodate the chocolate so nothing happens to him.\\n45: we can tap to remove the air bubbles and we we take this directly to the freezer after the cooling time and at We can unmold.\\n46: it is super easy because the silicone mold, and that's why I super love them.\\n47: just be careful when removing the stick so that don't let them go.\\n48: I have my three perfect palettes- see what shiny.\\n49: I know chocolate, and now we are going to make the decorations.\\n50: I am going to use fondant, and they can use chocolate, fondant or whatever they have on hand.\\n51: I'm just going to make a ball and press between my index finger and thumb to form a kind of triangle.\\n52: these are going to be the ears.\\n53: now, with a Shaper like this, I'm going to press to form the little hole of the ears.\\n54: this is not.\\n55: it's going to be a unicorn without a unicorn horn.\\n56: so to make the horn, we are going to stretch a piece of fondant into a band as long and thinner than we can.\\n57: then we fold it in half and begin to interlace.\\n58: it is very similar to make a braid, but with two ends, and then we roll it all together slightly so that the fondant sticks.\\n59: [Music].\\n60: we cut into segments depending on the long, from our chulito to me here, I calculate that I will get 3 horns, and then we are going to shape the tips.\\n61: we are just going to do this when not thumb and forefinger to stack the tip of the egg and music] and music].\\n62: [Music].\\n63: and once they have all their pieces armed, then we are going to give you some bling bling with these magic powders that They are called tint powders.\\n64: I'm using the color gold and I'm only going to put a little bit in the middle of the ears with a skewer and to turn the nuanced powder into a flowable paint.\\n65: I'm adding some liquor from orange, although they can use any clear liquor like vodka or rum, and this is how I'm going to paint all the horns.\\n66: [Music].\\n67: while we let this dry, let's go to prepare the royal racing icing to make the other decorations as well.\\n68: we will make the icing sugar so that we do not have any type of groups, and then we add the meringue powder- is very important because it is what it will do- let our frosting harden and finally, the warm water, and we simply beat these three ingredients until we have one homogeneous and thick mixture.\\n69: ah, and and [Music].\\n70: i divided the frosting into three equal parts so that he could paint it with gel colorants in pastel, pink, blue and yellow colors, then deposit them in pastry sleeves with these different pints.\\n71: the three days are curly, but they are of different sizes to achieve different effects, but before to decorate on our palettes, because we are going to practice a little at the table, mainly in the stars.\\n72: the recipes are very easy.\\n73: we only have, We have to practice a little, and we press and release and we will have our stiletto for the rosette.\\n74: we start in the center, we turn and stop, and now we are going to start with a little white chocolate stick, the horn and the ears.\\n75: the horn goes in the middle and the ears on the sides of our palette.\\n76: i [Music].\\n77: and now it's time to decorate with the glaze.\\n78: I'm going to start with a roll on this side.\\n79: you do not have to follow a specific order, just go interleaving the colors and sizes of yours to achieve the effect.\\n80: who want can use any kind of colored farms.\\n81: there are some sprinkles that are in the shape of a flower star.\\n82: everything applies to this decoration.\\n83: to make the eyes, I am using melted dark chocolate.\\n84: inside a paper course are only two ties with some sticks to simulate the tabs.\\n85: if you do not want to make a mistake before, you can mark it with a toothpick, and that way it will be a little easier.\\n86: I put two dots on the nose because they felt it looked, weird, sounded, and then I did the eyelashes.\\n87: but the secret is to do this very carefully and patiently, to make no mistake.\\n88: [Music]: to give it a touch of tenderness, paint the badges with door nuances in hot pink.\\n89: another option is to make the unicorn flipping sideways.\\n90: so let's stick the horn in this part here and just one ear on the other side, and we do exactly the same.\\n91: we fill all the spaces with stars or curls, with the different colors and doubts we have, and [Music], we have to fill the whole side of the horn back.\\n92: this is going to be like your mane and we were super pretty.\\n93: see that, nothing more.\\n94: and now we have to draw the little eye.\\n95: that will also be like the little eye.\\n96: and finally, I am going to give a touch of hue to d'or in gold color here in the eyelid, said, nothing more to give it an extra touch.\\n97: as you see, it is very easy and it looks super good.\\n98: I think it's the most I've done on this channel and it looks super, father, is entertaining and fun at the same time, because we mix the colors in magic, all this, the magic of an icon that drives us crazy so much.\\n99: have to do it for real.\\n100: the eyes of the latter- I made them different- are like elongated, so make the eyes that are easier for you.\\n101: [Music] all for the recipe today.\\n102: the truth is that they do not have to do.\\n103: this of the magic of rich is not a super strong world trend, and the truth is that that's a cute little magical pair.\\n104: so they really have to try.\\n105: and well, you know that you can follow all my social networks like

make the cake of unicorn, but the truth is that I feel that she is the most cake reproduced in youtube story.\\n4: so that's why I'm going to make another idea, because I had also been asked to make

each upload a new video.\\n8: and now, if we are going to start [Music], before starting I want to tell you that be the same yogurt pot to measure some of the ingredients of greater volume.\\n9: anyway, I left the ingredients in grams and volume so that, well, they always have more options if they do not have a scale and have no problem making this recipe, which is super, super easy.\\n10: here I am measuring, for example, the sugar- I also gave myself in the same way, obviously, the yogurt and flour.\\n11: here I already have all my ingredients, they are already thought and organized and we are going to start.\\n12: in a bowl, put the yogurt, natural unsweetened vegetable oil- I am using sunflower oil, but they can use any that have sugar at home too- and we mix it until it is incorporated a little, and then we break the egg- [Music] and we incorporated it very well, add the orange zest, which can also be lemon zest, or a teaspoon of vanilla- that is what will give flavor to our mixture.\\n13: of course, a little baking powder to make this sponge and incorporate very well, and at the end we add the flour.\\n14: the flour is only previously eternity.\\n15: as you see, it is very little quantity, so very easy to handle and mix with a blog whisk.\\n16: stop beating as soon as the mixture looks homogeneous.\\n17: this mixture should be a little dense, like the hot

like a long thing and this kind of roll it up.\\n66: but you really all you have to do really just kind of Pat it out a little bit like that and just kind of roll it up.\\n67: you know that's it.\\n68: look at that.\\n69: see, the bottom goes down there.\\n70: you tuck in the ends and it's ready for the pan I'm going to use.\\n71: I'm using like a standard 9 by 5 low fan, but this one, the bottom, just in case you're curious, is but just about 4 inches across on the bottom.\\n72: that's the size of pan I'm using.\\n73: so now put into the pan.\\n74: I don't have to grease it like that.\\n75: we're going to cover it.\\n76: put it in a warm spot to rise, for my mine is always 35 minutes.\\n77: so in about 35 minutes you rise it until it's 1 inch above the top.\\n78: let me show you: you rise it till it's 1 inch above the top of the pan, no more, because it's gonna really pop up in the oven.\\n79: so 35 minutes in a warm spot and we're gonna bake some bread.\\n80: so while your breads rising, you'll need to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, which I've done, and it's ready for the oven when it looks like this: tada, it needs to be just about an inch above the rim and not too much more than that.\\n81: now here's my ruler.\\n82: I think it's about an inch above, and don't be tempted to rise it too much longer because it will puff up in the oven.\\n83: so it is totally ready to go into your 375 oven for 30 minutes, set your timer for 30 minutes and then we got whole wheat bread.\\n84: now, about halfway through the baking, at about 15 minutes, I'd like to put a foil tent on the top of the loaf to keep it from getting too Brown, because it Browns quite a bit.\\n85: so just take some foil, this and I used to try to make a tent and shape it and they would fly all over the place.\\n86: so now I find it by scrunching it like that it holds its shape much better.\\n87: so I scrunch it and then I make a chance and I'm making the tent dull side towards the bread so that doesn't get any extra heat.\\n88: and there's my tent so you can kind of shape it.\\n89: when it's crunched like that, he's gonna run in there.\\n90: keep, don't let the oven stay open too long, just gonna pop the oven open and put this on the top of the bread for the final 15 minutes.\\n91: here it is.\\n92: look at this.\\n93: is that beautiful?\\n94: I told you 90 minutes start to finish.\\n95: this loaf speaks for itself.\\n96: what else can I say?\\n97: you can do this.\\n98: it's simple recipe.\\n99: have to just remember to have all your ingredients at room temperature and you can do it.\\n100: it's real easy.\\n101: if you ever forget to warm up your egg- you know sometimes I've forgotten and it's still cold- you can warm it up against your body, the body heat.\\n102: you can put it in in an apron or like in a pocket or wherever, yeah, but in here it's easier.\\n103: if you have cleavage, okay, just don't forget it's in there, and no surprises what.\\n104: you can be married.\\n105: oh my god.\\n106: what can you do?\\n107: that's exciting- in 15 minutes, with your clothes on: make salmon patties.\\n108: here is all you need to make my quick and easy salmon patties: a can of salmon, a slice of whole wheat bread, some onion, red pepper, parsley and an egg.\\n109: and that's how simple is.\\n110: you are going to love this.\\n111: I'm about to show you how to make quick, easy, healthy, delicious chocolate brownies, and wait till you see what's in them and what's not.\\n\\n### Instructions:\\nDetermine if the above captions provide enough information to answer the question.

like a long thing and this kind of roll it up.\\n66: but you really all you have to do really just kind of Pat it out a little bit like that and just kind of roll it up.\\n67: you know that's it.\\n68: look at that.\\n69: see, the bottom goes down there.\\n70: you tuck in the ends and it's ready for the pan I'm going to use.\\n71: I'm using like a standard 9 by 5 low fan, but this one, the bottom, just in case you're curious, is but just about 4 inches across on the bottom.\\n72: that's the size of pan I'm using.\\n73: so now put into the pan.\\n74: I don't have to grease it like that.\\n75: we're going to cover it.\\n76: put it in a warm spot to rise, for my mine is always 35 minutes.\\n77: so in about 35 minutes you rise it until it's 1 inch above the top.\\n78: let me show you: you rise it till it's 1 inch above the top of the pan, no more, because it's gonna really pop up in the oven.\\n79: so 35 minutes in a warm spot and we're gonna bake some bread.\\n80: so while your breads rising, you'll need to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, which I've done, and it's ready for the oven when it looks like this: tada, it needs to be just about an inch above the rim and not too much more than that.\\n81: now here's my ruler.\\n82: I think it's about an inch above, and don't be tempted to rise it too much longer because it will puff up in the oven.\\n83: so it is totally ready to go into your 375 oven for 30 minutes, set your timer for 30 minutes and then we got whole wheat bread.\\n84: now, about halfway through the baking, at about 15 minutes, I'd like to put a foil tent on the top of the loaf to keep it from getting too Brown, because it Browns quite a bit.\\n85: so just take some foil, this and I used to try to make a tent and shape it and they would fly all over the place.\\n86: so now I find it by scrunching it like that it holds its shape much better.\\n87: so I scrunch it and then I make a chance and I'm making the tent dull side towards the bread so that doesn't get any extra heat.\\n88: and there's my tent so you can kind of shape it.\\n89: when it's crunched like that, he's gonna run in there.\\n90: keep, don't let the oven stay open too long, just gonna pop the oven open and put this on the top of the bread for the final 15 minutes.\\n91: here it is.\\n92: look at this.\\n93: is that beautiful?\\n94: I told you 90 minutes start to finish.\\n95: this loaf speaks for itself.\\n96: what else can I say?\\n97: you can do this.\\n98: it's simple recipe.\\n99: have to just remember to have all your ingredients at room temperature and you can do it.\\n100: it's real easy.\\n101: if you ever forget to warm up your egg- you know sometimes I've forgotten and it's still cold- you can warm it up against your body, the body heat.\\n102: you can put it in in an apron or like in a pocket or wherever, yeah, but in here it's easier.\\n103: if you have cleavage, okay, just don't forget it's in there, and no surprises what.\\n104: you can be married.\\n105: oh my god.\\n106: what can you do?\\n107: that's exciting- in 15 minutes, with your clothes on: make salmon patties.\\n108: here is all you need to make my quick and easy salmon patties: a can of salmon, a slice of whole wheat bread, some onion, red pepper, parsley and an egg.\\n109: and that's how simple is.\\n110: you are going to love this.\\n111: I'm about to show you how to make quick, easy, healthy, delicious chocolate brownies, and wait till you see what's in them and what's not.\\n\\n### Instructions:\\nDetermine the two captions that are most useful in answering the question.

won't come or it'll run but it won't hold the correct temperature.\\n12: so if you have any of those problems, you may have to change your cold control.\\n13: in order to do the repair, we have to open up the refrigerator door.\\n14: first thing we have to do is remove this cover.\\n15: tell them by one Phillips screw.\\n16: once we have this off, it'll show the screw for the second cover so we can take that off.\\n17: it's also a Philips.\\n18: once we have the screw out, we can just pull the cover out and that will give us access to the damper assembly with the cold control on.\\n19: in order to get the part out, we have to take out this control panel section.\\n20: tell them: buy four screws and we have to take this trim off the front to get the other two off their quarter-inch screws.\\n21: so we'll do the back to first.\\n22: all right.\\n23: next thing you have to do is take a small screwdriver and pop these knobs out and then we can go ahead and get behind this front trim and pop it off.\\n24: be very careful you're taking it off.\\n25: you don't want to break it.\\n26: another way of the front panel off, we can take out these two screws to get access to inside.\\n27: now that we have the four screws out, we have access to all the parts inside.\\n28: now that we have the control panel taken apart, we have access to the control.\\n29: we have to take the screws out that hold this bracket in place so we can lift it up, so we can actually get to these quarter-inch screws that hold the control in place.\\n30: so we're going to take these two screws out and remove the control.\\n31: all right.\\n32: in order to get the control out, first thing we're going to do is remove the wires.\\n33: got the double black on top and the orange on the bottom.\\n34: you can use a small screwdriver to get these off if they're tight- and then the ground wire- all right.\\n35: since we took the screws out on the bottom, we can now lift this control up a little bit so we can get the screws out- quarter-inch screws.\\n36: in order to remove the control, we have to remove this capillary tube that goes back through this little clip right here.\\n37: so all you have to do is kind of pull up against it and it will just come through.\\n38: in order to remove the cold control, we have to remove the capillary tube from.\\n39: these little clips should just pop out, and then we can pull the capillary tube up through the control.\\n40: here's the old thermostat next to the new thermostat.\\n41: if you already have one of these, great.\\n42: if not, you can get it out.\\n43: appliance parts pros, comm.\\n44: the only thing we have to do is take this plastic sleeve off the old capillary and put it onto the new one.\\n45: so we're going to make sure we straighten the capillary up- really good- and pull it off.\\n46: once you have it off, we can go ahead and put it onto the new one.\\n47: the new capillary comes all coiled up, so you have to straighten it out.\\n48: you want to be very careful that you don't kink this capillary.\\n49: it is a hollow tube and if you can't get or damage it, it's not going to give you the proper temperature.\\n50: alright, once you have it pretty straight, we're going to take the plastic tubing and just feed it back up the capillary again, be very careful that you don't kink this tubing, though, as you'll be buying another one.\\n51: you want to slide it on there.\\n52: so the tip of the capillary is right at the very end.\\n53: if you stretch the plastic out while you were pulling it out and you have a little bit of extra, you can trim it off.\\n54: so it's right at the end of the capillary tube.\\n55: now that we have that installed onto the new one, we can go ahead and put the control back into the refrigerator.\\n56: it's going to mount right here, and then we have to run the capillary tube through there.\\n57: so we're going to stick this tube in and kind of reach from behind and guide it through.\\n58: all right, when you're remounting the thermostat, make sure that you put the bracket behind the thermostat mounting ears.\\n59: this screw is actually going to the sheet metal, not the actual control.\\n60: all right, now that we have the control remounted, we can remount this bracket.\\n61: when you put it back down, make sure that this cam goes in that little notch right there so it can control your freezer temperature.\\n62: and to put that back in, it was the Philips screws from underneath.\\n63: all right, now that we have everything remounted, we can reconnect the wires.\\n64: we got the grounding wire, the orange was on the bottom and the double block was on top.\\n65: we're going to put this up and out of the way so we can show you how to put a capillary tube on without this thing hanging in a way, and then we'll finish putting this together in a minute to do with the big washers go.\\n66: in order to finish installing the capillary tube, we have to make sure that we bring it over the top, bring it around and through the clips to mount it.\\n67: so all we have to do stretch it over the back and then get it into these little clips to mount it again and then click in the top bar.\\n68: all right, that's it.\\n69: we have the capillary tube installed.\\n70: it's not interfering with the damper control.\\n71: now that we have everything reinstalled, we can put the covers back on, make sure this little tab goes up in the slot.\\n72: the front half is held on by your Philips screw.\\n73: second cover goes on the same way.\\n74: what you do is put it up there and put screw back in and then we can put the control panel back on.\\n75: it hooks in on the bottom.\\n76: these grooves right here go right in, get these slots and then you push it up and snap it into place.\\n77: all right, the last thing we have to put on is the control knobs.\\n78: remember the one with the funky back is the refrigerator control.\\n79: on the top is the narrow part and on the bottom is the wide part.\\n80: so we're going to make sure this narrow part goes towards the top and the wide part is towards the bottom.\\n81: wherever your control happens to be lined up.\\n82: it may be a little bit different, but you just have to look in there to see.\\n83: and then on the freezer control, just a d-shaped knob.\\n84: so we're going to get the flat right there and match up the flat and put it in.\\n85: and you just want to make sure, since we took this all apart, you can turn these to make sure they spin freely and then set it to whatever you want for your refrigerator.\\n86: now that you're done repairing your refrigerator, you can plug it back in, make sure that it starts to cool off and that the temperatures return to normal.\\n87:

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhi pailin. new to your channel 😉 love the bread recipe. can you stuff it?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: (lively music) - Hey everyone.\\n1: Welcome to Pai\\'s Kitchen.\\n2: I am making my very first bread recipe of the show, but not any kind of bread.\\n3: I am making Asian-style fluffy, light as cloud bread.\\n4: Now in Asia, they like to call this Hokkaido milk bun, not because I\\'m using milk from Hokkaido or anything.\\n5: That\\'s just the name that they use.\\n6: There is a lot of milk in the recipe, which is one of the secret to its fluffiness.\\n7: Now if you have been intimidated by bread baking, I get you, I\\'ve been there, but trust me.\\n8: This recipe is very forgiving.\\n9: Give it a go.\\n10: I think you\\'re going to have success.\\n11: So, let\\'s get started.\\n12: So, the very first thing I\\'ve got to make is what\\'s called a milk roux, or tangzhong in, I believe, Chinese.\\n13: This is the secret to the fluffiness and softness of the bread.\\n14: It\\'s super, super easy.\\n15: Okay, it\\'s just two ingredient, milk and flour, so I got here some whole milk.\\n16: Wee!\\n17: And into this I\\'m gonna add some flour.\\n18: And I\\'m using bread flour because we are after all making bread.\\n19: Bread flour is high in gluten.\\n20: It\\'s gonna allow you to create that chewiness of the bread.\\n21: So I\\'m gonna give this a whisk to make sure I get rid of any flour lumps.\\n22: Now I\\'m gonna turn this on.\\n23: And once I turn the heat on, I wanna be stirring all the time.\\n24: Once the milk starts heating up, it starts getting thicker.\\n25: That\\'s exactly what you\\'re going for.\\n26: Oh, look at that, look at that.\\n27: And once it\\'s super thick like this, basically, once it\\'s not getting any thicker than where it\\'s at, turn off the heat.\\n28: So you might be thinking, \"What the heck is she doing? \"I thought we were making bread.\\n29: \"Why is she making this goo?\" So, what\\'s happening is in order to have fluffy and soft bread, you need a lot of moisture content in the bread.\\n30: But if I were to add all of that milk into my dough straight, the dough would be so wet and I couldn\\'t really handle it, right?\\n31: But by making a roux, you\\'ve turned the liquid milk into this thick paste, and so I am now able to force this much liquid into the dough, without making the dough too wet.\\n32: Brilliant, right?\\n33: And this is a secret for a lot of Asian style bread.\\n34: When I found out about it, it\\'s...\\n35: It\\'s amazing.\\n36: So that\\'s it!\\n37: So now my tangzhong is still a little bit warm.\\n38: I\\'m gonna add it to my liquid ingredients here.\\n39: So I\\'ve got some evaporated milk.\\n40: And you can use regular milk.\\n41: I just find evaporated milk is like extra milky milk.\\n42: (laughs) It\\'s richer and more delicious, but, totally, regular whole milk is fine.\\n43: No skim milk though.\\n44: No skim milk.\\n45: And this just helps it cool down, so you don\\'t have to sit there and wait for this paste to cool down.\\n46: Eggs.\\n47: Well, egg.\\n48: This is one egg.\\n49: Give that a quick stir.\\n50: Again, don\\'t worry about the tangzhong being still lumpy.\\n51: it will get all kneaded out.\\n52: Okay, so I am using my beautiful pink machine here.\\n53: You can do this all by hand.\\n54: So, in here, I\\'m going in with bread flour, and I have done this, half whole wheat, half white flour.\\n55: That worked really well as well.\\n56: So if you wanna make this a little healthier, you can.\\n57: So I like to always use instant yeast, instead of active dry yeast.\\n58: It\\'s just so much easier to work with.\\n59: You just add it to your dry ingredients, and you don\\'t have to worry about blooming it and all that stuff, and the results are the same.\\n60: So I\\'m just gonna give this a quick, just mix with my hand just to get the yeast all mixed in there a little bit.\\n61: All my liquids going in.\\n62: So all I\\'m gonna do right now is mix the dough just until the dry flour is absorbed.\\n63: We\\'re not gonna really knead it knead it.\\n64: (machine whirring) Okay, so that\\'s good enough.\\n65: So there\\'s no more dry flour in the mix, but the dough is still quite rough.\\n66: I\\'m gonna let it rest at this point for 20 minutes.\\n67: And this is a process called autolyse.\\n68: I think that\\'s how you pronounce it.\\n69: And this process allows hydration of the flour and for gluten development without kneading and therefore oxidizing the dough.\\n70: Because if you knead the dough too much, it actually negatively affects the flavor and the texture of the bread.\\n71: So this way, you won\\'t end up needing to knead the bread.\\n72: That\\'s a lot of kneed!\\n73: You won\\'t need to knead the bread for as much time.\\n74: So the bread is well-rested.\\n75: We\\'re now gonna continue the kneading process.\\n76: So I\\'ll make sure I\\'ll lock this first, and on low.\\n77: And now, I\\'m going to add my seasoning, my salt and sugar.\\n78: And I didn\\'t add the salt and sugar in the beginning, because it can interfere with the autolysis.\\n79: And the sugar, you can actually add more.\\n80: I\\'m only adding a couple tablespoons.\\n81: If you want this to be a sweeter bread, I found that three works really well.\\n82: Four will make it distinctly sweet, so it just depends on what kind of bread you\\'re going for.\\n83: So when you first add the sugar and the salt, it\\'ll kinda spin like crazy.\\n84: So I just like to stop it and scrape it off the hook.\\n85: and basically you wanna keep kneading.\\n86: Keep kneading it until it\\'s smooth, okay.\\n87: And I like to, every minute or so, take it off the hook and just re-adjust because I find you get a piece that\\'s stuck right here that\\'s not getting kneaded.\\n88: (lively music) The bread is now relatively smooth.\\n89: Mmm.\\n90: I love touching dough.\\n91: One very important ingredient that we need to add, and I\\'m just gonna take this off the hook.\\n92: I\\'m gonna add butter, and you wanna leave the butter till the end.\\n93: Because if you add it in the beginning, it\\'ll interfere with the gluten development, and your bread won\\'t have as much extensibility.\\n94: As the machine is running, just a little at a time.\\n95: And at first, it doesn\\'t look it wants to be mixed.\\n96: See how it\\'s just kinda like spinning around now.\\n97: Do not worry.\\n98: We will fix that.\\n99: Okay.\\n100: I\\'m gonna stop that and then pull everything off the hook, and scrape the sides a little bit.\\n101: And the reason why I like to make this bread also, that if you buy this bread, like Asian style bread from an Asian bakery, a lot of times they\\'ll use margarine, and that\\'s not good for you.\\n102: It\\'s so bad for you.\\n103: It\\'s all sorts of trans fats.\\n104: If I make it, I know I\\'m using real butter.\\n105: It taste better, it\\'s better for you.\\n106: It will work itself in, I promise.\\n107: (machine whirring) So that mess of butter eventually, with your patience, absorbs into the bread, and you\\'ve got nice smooth dough.\\n108: So now I\\'ve got a big bowl for my bread to proof in, but I wanna make sure I brush it with oil or melted butter with a mini brush of course.\\n109: I always like to finish final kneading by hand before I let it proof, because, you know, I just feel like it\\'s more evenly kneaded if I do it by hand at the end, and I just love touching dough.\\n110: Like it\\'s just hmm, so soft.\\n111: So now that it\\'s nice and smooth like a baby\\'s bottom, you just let this rest in that bowl that we\\'ve greased.\\n112: And we wanna turn this around to get it completely coated in oil, because as this rise, I wanna put plastic wrap over it.\\n113: If this top part is not greased, it\\'ll stick to the cling film.\\n114: And now this just needs to rest on room temperature for one hour or until it doubles in size.\\n115: If it\\'s really cold where you are, it might take a little longer.\\n116: If you don\\'t have time, you can also let it do a slow cold fermentation in the fridge.\\n117: That means you cover it, put it in the fridge, and then just continue with the recipe over night, so tomorrow, okay?\\n118: Woo!\\n119: Look at this bread.\\n120: So it\\'s been about 15 minutes on my end, because it\\'s really warm in this place.\\n121: I find bread baking just so satisfying.\\n122: You see that and you\\'re like, \"Oh, that worked.\" Okay, so now what you wanna do is take it out and degas it.\\n123: Press all the air out of that.\\n124: So at this point, we\\'re at the shaping stage.\\n125: And you can shape this to whatever shape you want.\\n126: You can do free-form buns, you can put them in loaf pans, you can put them, anything.\\n127: What I\\'m gonna do is I\\'m gonna do pull-apart buns.\\n128: So I\\'ll put buns in a round cake pan, and then when you go to serve it, people can pull apart.\\n129: I just find the pulling apart of buns one of the most satisfying things ever.\\n130: For my eight-inch round cake pan, I can put eight buns in here, and then I\\'ll end up with three buns left over that I will then bake as free-form buns.\\n131: Okay, so you\\'ll just have to work with whatever size pans you\\'ve got.\\n132: So each bun is going to be about 65 grams.\\n133: So I\\'m gonna just weigh each one.\\n134: 67!\\n135: I\\'m good at this.\\n136: All right.\\n137: You wanna form each bun into a bun.\\n138: (laughs) So I\\'m gonna just sort of press everything down, and then gather the edges.\\n139: And then by doing this, what you create is a smooth skin on the other side.\\n140: And then what I do is I grab it with my hand, and I pull it.\\n141: And my pinky is sort of dragging the bottom, and then you get this nice little cute bun.\\n142: Look how cute that is!\\n143: And that\\'s all you do, and then you pop it in your cake pans.\\n144: Yey, and look at my beautiful flower-shaped buns.\\n145: So these will need to proof again.\\n146: This time I find it takes slightly less time, 45 minutes should do it.\\n147: But again, if it\\'s colder it\\'s gonna take a little longer.\\n148: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and I\\'ll see you in a little bit.\\n149: Look at my bread, and it\\'s puffed up.\\n150: It\\'s ready to go into the oven.\\n151: So I\\'m going to stick it in, and then I\\'m gonna just reduce the temperature to 350, and that\\'s gonna bake for...\\n152: The free-form will bake for about 15, and the cake pans will bake for about 20 to 25, and that\\'s it.\\n153: And then you\\'ll have soft, fluffy, white bread.\\n154: Mmm.\\n155: Look at this.\\n156: Look how beautiful these are.\\n157: I\\'m gonna flip it out.\\n158: It\\'s still pretty hot.\\n159: Ahh!\\n160: Ta-dah!\\n161: Whoop!\\n162: I don\\'t like to let it completely cool in the pan, because I find the bottoms are to get soggy.\\n163: Once it\\'s got, like, five minutes flip it out onto a rack and let it cool completely, but I wanna show you this.\\n164: Look at this texture of this bread.\\n165: Oh yeah.\\n166: Look at that.\\n167: Look how soft and fluffy this texture looks.\\n168: I mean you can just tell that\\'s good stuff, right?\\n169: Look at that.\\n170: Smells so good, so buttery.\\n171: It\\'s still warm.\\n172: Oh it\\'s like white bread perfection.\\n173: It\\'s so soft, but at the same time chewy and buttery.\\n174: Just a hint of sweet.\\n175: Two table spoons of sugar will give you a neutral bread that\\'ll work in savory, sort of like as a dinner roll or a sandwich, or as a sweet bread.\\n176: You wanna fill it with something sweet, so good.\\n177: Now, this is actually a really, really good base dough if you wanna start filling it, wrapping it, turning it into all sorts of different cool creations.\\n178: And yes, I will have something coming up, so definitely stay tuned.\\n179: This is super useful dough.\\n180: But seriously, if I just have this, oh, maybe dip it in some condensed milk or dip it in my pandan custard.\\n181: Ah, perfect.\\n182: So the recipe, as always, will be on

information to answer the question.  Output 1 if the question can be answered, output 0 if the question cannot be answered. In case of a 1, also provide the caption numbers that provide the evidence for the answer.\\n\\n### Answer:\\n1, 128-132, 137, 145\\n\\n### Explanation:\\nThe question asks if the bread recipe can be stuffed. The captions provide evidence that the bread can be shaped into pull-apart buns (128-132) and that the buns can be put in round cake pans (131). The questioner also mentions that they like the idea of pull-apart buns (129), which is consistent with the information in the captions. Additionally, the captions mention that there will be three buns left over that can be baked as free-form buns (130), suggesting that the dough can be stuffed into various shapes. The captions also mention that the dough can be used as a base for filling and wrapping to create different creations (178-179), further indicating that the dough can be stuffed. Therefore, the answer is 1 and the evidence is in captions 128-132, 137, 145, and 178-179.</s>',\n",

show you how to make it home today.\\n1: the first is mango and coconut.\\n2: so here is a beautiful, ripe mango.\\n3: I'm going to show how to peel indi stone it, so round ones, we need a flat surface.\\n4: we're going to just top and tail it just so it stands up.\\n5: that will enable us to cut all the way down and peel it, keeping as close to the peel as possible so we're not wasting mango, always cutting down towards the board.\\n6: next up you've got a stone that runs pretty much down the middle, so you want to try and guess and cut either side of it roughly, there and there.\\n7: this isn't a predominately stone, you can see it there, but we cut around the edge.\\n8: we can get rid of all of this bit as well.\\n9: roughly dice the first we've got.\\n10: then all we need to do is place your diced mango into a blender along with a tin of coconut.\\n11: go for fat desiccated coconut, coconut oil- we just warmed up slightly- and the zest of a knife.\\n12: now Ben mentions the word fruit instead of mango, because actually we've gone for mango here, but you could also use- this is something you told us- passion fruit, pineapple- somebody mentioned durian, if you're that way inclined, but makes it known enough- but basically any kind of tropical fruit that you want to put in here, do it.\\n13: you think we're teaching you one recipe today lies we're teaching you what you're left with is something smooth and delicious, but you need to make sure you're happy with how it tastes now, because all you're going to do is freeze it, so it needs to be as good now as it will be later.\\n14: this is just a smoothing really at this point, isn't it?\\n15: yeah, so a cornucopia of flavors, tropical and fruit.\\n16: oh, that's good, and now you can freeze it whatever you like.\\n17: so lolly molds, wooden sticks- we listen to you guys and went with exactly what you want.\\n18: was it what they wanted been or was it what you wanted?\\n19: it was the most popular choice.\\n20: the silicon, the silicon ice pops called month.\\n21: Oh, pop, pop, popsicle.\\n22: she.\\n23: obviously some rooms are going to expand when they freeze our science, okay, not sides, just common sense, Ben, this is one of the simplest recipes we've ever done.\\n24: on sorted, did you get that on my keys popping back out again.\\n25: it's gotta come back.\\n26: you my one word.\\n27: you have made a right conceive.\\n28: your zone, we're in.\\n29: right, get those in the freezer.\\n30: lucky you guys ain't seen that right.\\n31: pop that into a freezer for at least four hours to well freeze physics in it.\\n32: what if you thought that popsicle was easy to make?\\n33: wait until you see this one.\\n34: just three ingredients.\\n35: we've got some natural Greek yogurt, which will add some nice tartness to it.\\n36: we have some Nutella, which is going to add a nice creaminess to it, and then we're going to add some pistachios, which is going to add a nice pistachio English crunch to it.\\n37: and if you think we're making these flavors up- what we kind of are, you could use any flavors.\\n38: if you want Nutella, just use a normal chocolate spread.\\n39: use something else.\\n40: we're using pistachios.\\n41: why not change that for hazelnuts or for peanuts or for whatever you like?\\n42: you can literally make these yourself.\\n43: like I said before, 372 different combinations give or take methods are saying they need blending up and freezing.\\n44: sorry, this is my favorite one and we're making a few just to demonstrate it.\\n45: if you're going to go to the effort maker, you might want make loads, because they're keeping the freezer for several months if they are covered after four or six hours.\\n46: you want to give these

Caption)):\\n0: whether you call them popsicles or ice lollies or something altogether different, they're the perfect thing to call you down in the summer and where you've got two fantastic flavors to show you how to make it home today.\\n1: the first is mango and coconut.\\n2: so here is a beautiful, ripe mango.\\n3: I'm going to show how to peel indi stone it, so round ones, we need a flat surface.\\n4: we're going to just top and tail it just so it stands up.\\n5: that will enable us to cut all the way down and peel it, keeping as close to the peel as possible so we're not wasting mango, always cutting down towards the board.\\n6: next up you've got a stone that runs pretty much down the middle, so you want to try and guess and cut either side of it roughly, there and there.\\n7: this isn't a predominately stone, you can see it there, but we cut around the edge.\\n8: we can get rid of all of this bit as well.\\n9: roughly dice the first we've got.\\n10: then all we need to do is place your diced mango into a blender along with a tin of coconut.\\n11: go for fat desiccated coconut, coconut oil- we just warmed up slightly- and the zest of a knife.\\n12: now Ben mentions the word fruit instead of mango, because actually we've gone for mango here, but you could also use- this is something you told us- passion fruit, pineapple- somebody mentioned durian, if you're that way inclined, but makes it known enough- but basically any kind of tropical fruit that you want to put in here, do it.\\n13: you think we're teaching you one recipe today lies we're teaching you what you're left with is something smooth and delicious, but you need to make sure you're happy with how it tastes now, because all you're going to do is freeze it, so it needs to be as good now as it will be later.\\n14: this is just a smoothing really at this point, isn't it?\\n15: yeah, so a cornucopia of flavors, tropical and fruit.\\n16: oh, that's good, and now you can freeze it whatever you like.\\n17: so lolly molds, wooden sticks- we listen to you guys and went with exactly what you want.\\n18: was it what they wanted been or was it what you wanted?\\n19: it was the most popular choice.\\n20: the silicon, the silicon ice pops called month.\\n21: Oh, pop, pop, popsicle.\\n22: she.\\n23: obviously some rooms are going to expand when they freeze our science, okay, not sides, just common sense, Ben, this is one of the simplest recipes we've ever done.\\n24: on sorted, did you get that on my keys popping back out again.\\n25: it's gotta come back.\\n26: you my one word.\\n27: you have made a right conceive.\\n28: your zone, we're in.\\n29: right, get those in the freezer.\\n30: lucky you guys ain't seen that right.\\n31: pop that into a freezer for at least four hours to well freeze physics in it.\\n32: what if you thought that popsicle was easy to make?\\n33: wait until you see this one.\\n34: just three ingredients.\\n35: we've got some natural Greek yogurt, which will add some nice tartness to it.\\n36: we have some Nutella, which is going to add a nice creaminess to it, and then we're going to add some pistachios, which is going to add a nice pistachio English crunch to it.\\n37: and if you think we're making these flavors up- what we kind of are, you could use any flavors.\\n38: if you want Nutella, just use a normal chocolate spread.\\n39: use something else.\\n40: we're using pistachios.\\n41: why not change that for hazelnuts or for peanuts or for whatever you like?\\n42: you can literally make these yourself.\\n43: like I said before, 372 different combinations give or take methods are saying they need blending up and freezing.\\n44: sorry, this is my favorite one and we're making a few just to demonstrate it.\\n45: if you're going to go to the effort maker, you might want make loads, because they're keeping the freezer for several months if they are covered after four or six hours.\\n46: you want to give these five or ten minutes out of the freezer before you try and squeeze them out, and with a bit of luck it's really good.\\n47: I poked my head out.\\n48: there we go.\\n49: Oh, up there is.\\n50: are you

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhow long does the seed batch last!? great video by the way.\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: today I'm gonna show you a really quick, cool, fun project.\\n1: I'm gonna show you how to make homemade yogurt.\\n2: this is so simple that you're gonna want to try it, just because now, the traditional way to make homemade yogurt requires you to order expensive cultures and yogurt making equipment.\\n3: you have to buy yogurt incubators because you have to keep the cultures at a constant temperature for long periods of time so they can incubate.\\n4: people have tried different methods to get this done at home without using the equipment.\\n5: some people put it in their oven and then they have to adjust the temperatures every hour for like 12 hours.\\n6: some people try slow cookers and they have to constantly go back and check it and adjust temperatures and turn it on and turn it off for like 2 days.\\n7: but this way that I'm gonna show you is super easy.\\n8: you can do it really quick at night before you go to bed, and if you do exactly as I tell you, you won't have to check it at all.\\n9: and when you get up in the morning, you have lots and lots and lots of yogurt made and it's super, super cheap.\\n10: and the best thing about this is that you're actually creating a very high quality yogurt with a lot of live, active cultures that are very good for gut health, for your immunity.\\n11: they help you to get your body back in balance, because a lot of people today have issues with Candida sand and yeast overgrowth because they've lost all of the good bacteria and they're good because of antibiotics and different things.\\n12: this helps to restore health to your your digestive tract and your whole body and helps to get all of that back in track.\\n13: so it's really good for you, it's really healthy and it's really, really easy.\\n14: and another quick tip is that once you make this yogurt, you can then use it to make cream cheese, which I'll show you how to do in the next upcoming video, but for right now, I'm going to show you what you need to do to make this quick, easy, simple, no hassle, no fuss: homemade yogurt very inexpensively, very easy, alright, all you're gonna need to make your yogurt is gallon of milk.\\n15: you can use whole milk, 2% milk, low-fat milk, it doesn't matter.\\n16: I like a rich yogurt, so I'm going with a whole milk.\\n17: but you can use the cheap store brand $3 gallon milk and you don't have to to go with anything special.\\n18: it doesn't have to be wrong.\\n19: you can use pasteurized milk.\\n20: so then you're gonna need what's called a yogurt seed.\\n21: if you're ordering the cultures online, they can be kind of expensive, but instead you can just go to the store and get a little $0.\\n22: 50 single serve container of yogurt that has live active cultures in it.\\n23: I couldn't find the little ones, so I got a big one just to kind of show you.\\n24: but you only have to buy that once, because once you make your yogurt then you can use some of the yogurt from your previous batch to start the next batch.\\n25: so you'll never have to buy this again.\\n26: you'll just keep a little bit of the yogurt that you already made.\\n27: but you want to check the labels, because some yogurts will say yogurt on the front but when you check it's not really yogurt.\\n28: it's just gelatin and fructose, corn syrup and flavorings and basically flavored pudding.\\n29: but real yogurt will have on the ingredients live active cultures.\\n30: sometimes it'll even list the cultures that are in there.\\n31: so you want to get something that has live cultures and since you're only buying this once, go ahead and get a good one that has a good variety of cultures, because you're actually gonna basically clone this yogurt in there and it's only gonna take a little bit.\\n32: so, like I said, you could get this moment.\\n33: you don't have to get the big one.\\n34: so here we go.\\n35: I'm going to show you how to do this really, really easy.\\n36: all right, we're gonna put a full gallon of milk into a pot.\\n37: make sure that it's a good, you know, thick pot, so it doesn't burn too easy.\\n38: you want to put it on about a medium heat and we're gonna slowly bring this up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.\\n39: we need to kill everything that's in this milk.\\n40: for most cheeses, you don't want dead milk, but for yogurt, you want dead milk, because we're gonna introduce our own bacteria and cultures and we want to make sure that it's very sterilized and create the optimal conditions for them to thrive.\\n41: so you don't want to do this too quickly because you don't want your to stick to the bottom.\\n42: it's gonna probably take about 10-15 minutes to bring it up to temperature.\\n43: so just watch your temperatures, get a thermometer and check it and every once in a while, come and stir it and make sure that no milk is sticking to the sides of the bottom.\\n44: and so we're just gonna go ahead and bring this up to 200 degrees and then I'll show you what to do next.\\n45: all right, when you reach 200 degrees, you go ahead and turn the heat off and we're gonna cool this down.\\n46: we can cool it down pretty quickly by placing the whole pot in the sink and cooling water and just put cool water around it.\\n47: I'll show you and we could get it cools down and really quick, probably within like 3 or 4 minutes.\\n48: if you put it in a sink with some cool water and kind of stir it, the cool water is gonna cool your pot and we need to cool this down to 110 degrees.\\n49: all right, once it's at 110 degrees, that's warm enough for the cultures to incubate, but not so hot that it would cook them and kill them.\\n50: if you want it thicker, like a Greek yogurt, you want to add about 1/2 a cup of powdered milk and just mix it in.\\n51: you take out about a cups worth into another dish so you can make sure that everything gets absolutely makes really well.\\n52: all right.\\n53: once your powdered milk is mixed, you want to put a couple of tablespoons worth of your yogurt with the live active cultures.\\n54: if you have the little single serve, just use the whole single serve.\\n55: if you have too large one, just about a cups worth.\\n56: couple, couple tablespoons and then, um, mix it in really good and make sure it's all well mixed.\\n57: working kind of quickly- because I don't want this to cool down too much- you're gonna go ahead and add that mixture back in and stir it up really good, make sure it's completely incorporated.\\n58: that's gonna save us from having to have expensive yogurt making equipment.\\n59: what we're gonna do is place the pot.\\n60: we have a just a cooler, just a cheap old ice chest.\\n61: we put a blanket in there, we put the hot pot in there and cover it up with the blanket, and this is gonna keep it at a constant 110 degrees for 12 hours or more, however long.\\n62: so we want to get it in there.\\n63: and then you're gonna take the milk jug that you got use for your milk and fill it up with hot water.\\n64: just use a tap water.\\n65: get the tap going as hot as you can- that's gonna be running usually typically about 110 degrees- and fill that up with hot, hot tap water.\\n66: that's going to help to hold the heat in and the ice chest.\\n67: and if it's particularly cold- you know, if it's the summer you don't need to do this, but if it's particularly cold you can also cover the whole ice chest with a blanket or a sleeping bag, and I made some last night and it was like in the 30s and it was in a part of the house that really isn't heated and it still did great.\\n68: when I opened it up 12 hours later, it was still the same temperature in there, doing it like this, so you can leave it.\\n69: you don't have to worry about it.\\n70: alright, so this is the great thing: we don't have to check it, we don't have to adjust temperatures, we don't have to buy expensive equipment.\\n71: we literally leave it alone.\\n72: we would go to bed, wake up in the morning and check it.\\n73: we're gonna have awesome homemade yogurt.\\n74: this is the easiest way, really.\\n75: it takes almost no effort at all.\\n76: we don't have to do anything.\\n77: we're going to bed.\\n78: so see you in the mornin and we'll see how it turned out.\\n79: alright, it's the next morning and all I did was get up and take the yogurt out of the cooler.\\n80: if there's a little clear liquid on top, that's okay.\\n81: some of the weight that's separating, you can leave it in or you can take it off, and so let's see how it's set up.\\n82: that's really, really awesome.\\n83: I'm about to give you a close-up so you can see it's really good, nice and thick, firm a little bit in here.\\n84: take another spoonful so you can see, when I cut it, how nice and firm that is.\\n85: so and it smells, smell it, oh, it smells so good, fresh, and this whole pot, that's a lot of yogurt.\\n86: like I said, you know, a little three dollar gallon of milk makes a lot of yogurt, and then, of course, you can just spoon it into mason jars.\\n87: one gallon a milk will make four of these mason jars, these large ones, and it'll also make one little one which I will then keep.\\n88: this will be my seed for the next batch of yogurt, so I don't have to keep buying yogurt.\\n89: I'll just use this for the next batch.\\n90: all right, so you can see we make a lot of yogurt very easy.\\n91: that was really no trouble at all.\\n92: it took a few minutes that the stove, put it in ice chest, go to bed, wake up and you have all of this yogurt.\\n93: now what's really cool about this is that you can actually turn this into cream cheese, and I'll show you how to do that in the next video.\\n94: some people call it yogurt cheese, but it really is cream cheese when you start from the milk process and go through all of this process of turning it into the yogurt and then in the cheese, then they call it cream cheese.\\n95: but if you start with yogurt they call it yogurt cheese.\\n96: but it really is the same thing.\\n97: the flavor is indistinguishable.\\n98: you can buy yogurt to make the yogurt cheese, but it's really not cost-efficient because if you're gonna spend five bucks for a little thing in yogurt, it's not gonna make that much cheese and so you do better to just go buy the cream cheese.\\n99: but if you're doing it like this, it is cost-efficient because you make so much.\\n100: I don't just I got a lot of milk now.\\n101: if you've never had plain yogurt and you taste this, then you might not like it, because what you buy in the store is obviously gonna be sweetened and flavoured.\\n102: so options for sweetening this: if you want it to taste just like it does from the store, you're gonna want to use a liquid sweetener.\\n103: of course in the stores they're gonna be using corn syrup, cane syrup, things like that.\\n104: you can even use powdered sugar and it will taste just like from the store.\\n105: if you want a healthier option, you can't use raw cane sugar.\\n106: but here's the thing: if you use the wrong cane sugar.\\n107: you need to mix it really good and then put it back in the fridge for like at least an hour so that sugar can really dissolve and mix in, or else it's gonna be kind of gritty because the granulated sugar doesn't dissolve as well.\\n108: so I tend to kind of stay more towards the liquid sweeteners.\\n109: so that much yogurt stays really smooth, I use honey.\\n110: you can use honey.\\n111: honey is gonna be your healthiest option.\\n112: if you're looking for a healthier way to sweeten your yogurt.\\n113: you can also use a good quality maple syrup, maple pecan granola.\\n114: it's a very good combination.\\n115: you can even use molasses to get some minerals in there, but you're gonna want to sweeten it.\\n116: and also you can flavor this with vanilla or you can flavor it with fruit.\\n117: now what you buy in the store is typically flavored with jams, jellies or preserves.\\n118: I find it is so much better with fresh fruit.\\n119: I don't really like the texture of that slimy, old preserved fruit in there.\\n120: so fresh fruit and even frozen fruits- pretty good.\\n121: you can throw frozen berries in here, but there's nothing that compares to the taste of fresh fruit yogurt, like when you bite into that strawberry and it's still crisp.\\n122: it's just amazing.\\n123: so try it.\\n124: make it, it's so simple.\\n125: put your own nuts, fruits, granola, anything in there, sweeten it however you want, use it in smoothies, use it to make more cheeses- it's too easy not to do and you get so much out of it.\\n126: make it and share it with friends and they'll be impressed.\\n127: believe me, it's really good.\\n128: once you mix it up with your sweetener and your fruits, gonna get this nice, pretty, creamy fruit at yogurt.\\n129: look to it and it tastes amazing.\\n130: this yogurt is amazing.\\n131: I'm telling you, nothing compares.\\n132: go ahead and try make it yourself.\\n133: it's really, really, really good.\\n\\n### Instructions:\\nDetermine if the above captions provide enough information to answer the

The method described in the video for making homemade yogurt does not require the use of a seed batch, as the yogurt from a previous batch is used to start the next one.

was still the same temperature in there, doing it like this, so you can leave it.\\n69: you don\\'t have to worry about it.\\n70: alright, so this is the great thing: we don\\'t have to check it, we don\\'t have to adjust temperatures, we don\\'t have to buy expensive equipment.\\n71: we literally leave it alone.\\n72: we would go to bed, wake up in the morning and check it.\\n73: we\\'re gonna have awesome homemade yogurt.\\n74: this is the easiest way, really.\\n75: it takes almost no effort at all.\\n76: we don\\'t have to do anything.\\n77: we\\'re going to bed.\\n78: so see you in the mornin and we\\'ll see how it turned out.\\n79: alright, it\\'s the next morning and all I did was get up and take the yogurt out of the cooler.\\n80: if there\\'s a little clear liquid on top, that\\'s okay.\\n81: some of the weight that\\'s separating, you can leave it in or you can take it off, and so let\\'s see how it\\'s set up.\\n82: that\\'s really, really awesome.\\n83: I\\'m about to give you a close-up so you can see it\\'s really good, nice and thick, firm a little bit in here.\\n84: take another spoonful so you can see, when I cut it, how nice and firm that is.\\n85: so and it smells, smell it, oh, it smells so good, fresh, and this whole pot, that\\'s a lot of yogurt.\\n86: like I said, you know, a little three dollar gallon of milk makes a lot of yogurt, and then, of course, you can just spoon it into mason jars.\\n87: one gallon a milk will make four of these mason jars, these large ones, and it\\'ll also make one little one which I will then keep.\\n88: this will be my seed for the next batch of yogurt, so I don\\'t have to keep buying yogurt.\\n89: I\\'ll just use this for the next batch.\\n90: all right, so you can see we make a lot of yogurt very easy.\\n91: that was really no trouble at all.\\n92: it took a few minutes that the stove, put it in ice chest, go to bed, wake up and you have all of this yogurt.\\n93: now what\\'s really cool about this is that you can actually turn this into cream cheese, and I\\'ll show you how to do that in the next video.\\n94: some people call it yogurt cheese, but it really is cream cheese when you start from the milk process and go through all of this process of turning it into the yogurt and then in the cheese, then they call it cream cheese.\\n95: but if you start with yogurt they call it yogurt cheese.\\n96: but it really is the same thing.\\n97: the flavor is indistinguishable.\\n98: you can buy yogurt to make the yogurt cheese, but it\\'s really not cost-efficient because if you\\'re gonna spend five bucks for a little thing in yogurt, it\\'s not gonna make that much cheese and so you do better to just go buy the cream cheese.\\n99: but if you\\'re doing it like this, it is cost-efficient because you make so much.\\n100: I don\\'t just I got a lot of milk now.\\n101: if you\\'ve never had plain yogurt and you taste this, then you might not like it, because what you buy in the store is obviously gonna be sweetened and flavoured.\\n102: so options for sweetening this: if you want it to taste just like it does from the store, you\\'re gonna want to use a liquid sweetener.\\n103: of course in the stores they\\'re gonna be using corn syrup, cane syrup, things like that.\\n104: you can even use powdered sugar and it will taste just like from the store.\\n105: if you want a healthier option, you can\\'t use raw cane sugar.\\n106: but here\\'s the thing: if you use the wrong cane sugar.\\n107: you need to mix it really good and then put it back in the fridge for like at least an hour so that sugar can really dissolve and mix in, or else it\\'s gonna be kind of gritty because the granulated sugar doesn\\'t dissolve as well.\\n108: so I tend to kind of stay more towards the liquid sweeteners.\\n109: so that much yogurt stays really smooth, I use honey.\\n110: you can use honey.\\n111: honey is gonna be your healthiest option.\\n112: if you\\'re looking for a healthier way to sweeten your yogurt.\\n113: you can also use a good quality maple syrup, maple pecan granola.\\n114: it\\'s a very good combination.\\n115: you can even use molasses to get some minerals in there, but you\\'re gonna want to sweeten it.\\n116: and also you can flavor this with vanilla or you can flavor it with fruit.\\n117: now what you buy in the store is typically flavored with jams, jellies or preserves.\\n118: I find it is so much better with fresh fruit.\\n119: I don\\'t really like the texture of that slimy, old preserved fruit in there.\\n120: so fresh fruit and even frozen fruits- pretty good.\\n121: you can throw frozen berries in here, but there\\'s nothing that compares to the taste of fresh fruit yogurt, like when you bite into that strawberry and it\\'s still crisp.\\n122: it\\'s just amazing.\\n123: so try it.\\n124: make it, it\\'s so simple.\\n125: put your own nuts, fruits, granola, anything in there, sweeten it however you want, use it in smoothies, use it to make more cheeses- it\\'s too easy not to do and you get so much out of it.\\n126: make it and share it with friends and they\\'ll be impressed.\\n127: believe me, it\\'s really good.\\n128: once you mix it up with your sweetener and your fruits, gonna get this nice, pretty, creamy fruit at yogurt.\\n129: look to it and it tastes amazing.\\n130: this yogurt is amazing.\\n131: I\\'m telling you, nothing compares.\\n132: go ahead and try make it yourself.\\n133: it\\'s really, really, really good.\\n\\n### Instructions:\\nDetermine the two captions that are most useful in answering the question.  Output the numbers of the two most useful captions:\\n\\nThe question asks \"how long does the seed batch last!?\" The video captions do not directly answer this question, but they do provide some information about making yogurt and using the previous batch as a seed for the next batch. Based on the information provided, it appears that the seed batch can be used to start the next batch of yogurt, so it does not have an expiration date in the same way that store-bought yogurt does.\\n\\nThe most useful captions for answering the question would be:\\n21: if you\\'re ordering the cultures online, they can be kind of expensive, but instead you can just go to the store and get a little $0.50 single serve container of yogurt that has live active cultures in it.\\n24: you only have to buy that once, because once you make your yogurt then you can use some of the yogurt from your previous batch to start the next batch.\\n\\nOutput: 21, 24</s>'},\n",

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\ni’ve been a professional decorator for over 10 years and have never, ever come across anyone roll before cutting in and especially not double coat the walls but only cut in with one coat. confusing but interesting to see how other do their thing. if it works for you then great but i’ll stick to cutting in, roll, cut in, roll.\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: this 60 ina mohair.\\n1: in this video we show you how in a room and 10 simple steps.\\n2: so the first step in painting a road is: you want to gather all your furniture.\\n3: you want to get it away from the wall- that leaf or feet away from the wall around the room, completely where- and it'll give you a easy working space.\\n4: you're not going to get pain on your furniture- the furnitures not going to be in your way.\\n5: if you can't get all the furniture out of the room, just try to get it to the center of the room and give it 4 feet away from the walls if you got a cut in your ceiling and you need a ladder to do so.\\n6: so step number 2 is you're going to gather all your supplies together once I get myself some working space in this room.\\n7: I was able to get everything out of this room.\\n8: that wasn't very much stuff, so I got myself a good clean room with no furniture in it.\\n9: I'm gonna lay down a drop off and that's going to be.\\n10: we're going to begin laying out.\\n11: I used to fly so I can begin working.\\n12: I'm going to set it dropped off now.\\n13: that's where my things going to go and all my do list is that I want to get any paint on the carpet.\\n14: then I'm going to begin the next step.\\n15: so in order to begin this painting process, you want to have some good quality painting tools.\\n16: I'll get all my tool together instead of dropped off down and begin covering this whole entire room with drop off with a good massive drop tub.\\n17: but I start off.\\n18: there's a few essential tools you're going to need is what is the cutting bucket with the roller and a brush?\\n19: I've got myself this.\\n20: I like a 2 gallon common bucket.\\n21: I just use a 1 gallon would rid and kind of bucket.\\n22: I like a 3 inch angle bristle brush right here to do all my painting with.\\n23: on the interior painting I used a 4 inch roller with a 3/8 inch nap.\\n24: that's my cutting set up on a small room like this.\\n25: I don't need a really large roller like an 18 inch level, or I could just use a 9 inch lower.\\n26: so got myself a 9 inch pan with just a throwing liner.\\n27: I'll have to worry about cleaning by pan.\\n28: got myself a nine inch roller with a 3/8 reading Finch nap nest cover on there.\\n29: get some holes in the walls.\\n30: I'm going to be tackling the holes in the walls there.\\n31: I got a hand master right here with one-inch tape and nine inch paper that we're going to be running around to protect our floors and protect our blinds and stuff with the taper to be using that.\\n32: use frog tape a lot now.\\n33: use 3m, 20, 21 inch tape on my interior master got ourself a baffle- nice to cycle any of the hole.\\n34: got a flathead screwdriver because it got bigger the switchblade.\\n35: I'm going to be popping my trim, doing our cocking method.\\n36: I'll be using a caulking gun here.\\n37: you got wood rims.\\n38: they're not going to be doing any.\\n39: any the talking of the wood trim, so we're just going to be using cloth tape.\\n40: but a lot of times we're using a caulking gun.\\n41: we've got a lot of drop cloth, but use the plastic runners and the actual camera style drop off nothing.\\n42: your enemies is a ladder.\\n43: so that's kind of some of the basic tools.\\n44: I also keep myself a razor knife or snap knife because if there's any furniture in here we want to cover it with plastic which is 9 by 4 out of plastic.\\n45: always got myself a five in one tool so I can open the panes and do any scraping if I drink to, and then it typically carried around a duster brush just to dust off the baseboards, tops of the, the door jams and window trim.\\n46: then I use myself a pair of rubber gloves that I'm getting paint out of my hand.\\n47: so there you have a clear, some of the essential tools, all the tools and accessories that I've used and like.\\n48: I keep them down from the video description.\\n49: he's always flying it down there.\\n50: so check out the video description or you can find them on my tool store at the.\\n51: I hope you, but here we go.\\n52: let's get going to the next step.\\n53: so step number three, with getting utters drop off all day now, got them all the way down to this floor the best we can, as we have any furniture where turnout.\\n54: so we got them all laid out.\\n55: now.\\n56: step number four is not seeing the rhythm.\\n57: we're going to use the nine inch taper twice.\\n58: take the master out our baseboard to give a little added protection, for anything with the baseboards are the rocks on top opposed to the base work.\\n59: we need to put in some masking on our window sills and they're going to roll for our blind run.\\n60: a piece of mass goes over the top of those blinds, so no, Kate will drip on most.\\n61: it's a big void our ceiling.\\n62: so we sucked this process.\\n63: this is denim whore.\\n64: it's part of step number four.\\n65: we're going to run around or one-inch Kate with that.\\n66: our drop-off down got a masking paper down.\\n67: we're going to about one is tape along our baseboards, door trim and a window trim.\\n68: so what's step will report them.\\n69: I'm going to move on to step notify and that's removing switched lengths and tackling the holes in the wall.\\n70: we got switch lights right here to want to remove all these switch lanes.\\n71: the very simple debris will remove.\\n72: I'm just using a flathead screwdriver just going to remove the switch plate, put it in a bucket, that way we can paint around it.\\n73: you know what I find?\\n74: remnants, which slaves.\\n75: so nothing ready to do this baffling.\\n76: just a few holes up here.\\n77: got some lightweight spackling and a flexible spackle knife right here to do this sapling.\\n78: I like the lightweight spackling to the drive really fast.\\n79: got some small holes.\\n80: it's going to stop on white.\\n81: the staff development knife wipe around it is good.\\n82: I really thought through what separates the dry spouses, this room.\\n83: that would take me more than four hours to paint this room so I got to have a faculty good guy five.\\n84: so step number six is glowing, the first color of the wall.\\n85: so goes out rolling our first code.\\n86: we got the thing all mouth off, going to roll a first tone.\\n87: we don't want to be really heavy things, we want it to drive really fast.\\n88: we get the heat turned up, we're going to get what we call it skin clothes on gear and our final coat, well, VI heavies go.\\n89: so here we go with the first count, step number six.\\n90: so we're kind of skin tone, we brighter out, given hope this thing.\\n91: it's going to dry.\\n92: really, what's that dry?\\n93: we begin our cutting process: to be cut in the ceiling.\\n94: you cut in the corner.\\n95: I'm going to roll around our switch plates, light switches, and then we'll be doing our cut ends along our baseboards and trim in wall.\\n96: that's lap.\\n97: then you go over it with your second color.\\n98: so step number seven is doing our cut in.\\n99: so here we go, you might as well be doing our cut in and we're going to start stat number eight now and that's rolling our second coat on our wall.\\n100: and this is.\\n101: there's a lot of different ways you can do this and just depends on how many people you have working with you, if you're by yourself, or if you've got wood trim, that's, or or you got painted signatures- talking, until there's a lot of different nothing.\\n102: they've got a bunch of different videos out there showing you different methods of doing this.\\n103: on this, right here, we got Woodson, we're not talking, and we just have to take right up next to the wood trim.\\n104: so we're doing our cut in and then you're going back and rolling our second coat.\\n105: so we applied the second photo right now.\\n106: okay, this is how many grow walls out if you want to roll the wall box using eighteen inch roller.\\n107: so now I'm going to step number nine, that's holding this Basking.\\n108: once again, this is a crucial step.\\n109: you don't want to let your paint or caulking and paint dry.\\n110: so I'm going to begin pulling all this, all the masking, off, that number nine, and I'm working in this zoom by myself right now.\\n111: so I'm just going to pull up this, this section, right here now.\\n112: the final step, step number 10, is doing the touch-ups and clean up.\\n113: I'm going to begin clanging all their stuff up, but before I clean it up, I got two coats on all I know that's good and done.\\n114: like do I try to get my cut in all around my doors, windows, baseboards and ceilings- often one tunnel inside- do it really heavy.\\n115: it's all I'm going to do is go back and just look for cut it or look for touch-ups in those areas and then pick up all the drop off, move out of here in the clean my brushes and mowers, and that's a very fast, easy process.\\n116: the deal is always going to pick you off 10-15 minutes.\\n117: hope you enjoyed this video.\\n118: hopefully we'll see you on

nice informative video\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: this 60 ina mohair.\\n1: in this video we show you how in a room and 10 simple steps.\\n2: so the first step in painting a road is: you want to gather all your furniture.\\n3: you want to get it away from the wall- that leaf or feet away from the wall around the room, completely where- and it'll give you a easy working space.\\n4: you're not going to get pain on your furniture- the furnitures not going to be in your way.\\n5: if you can't get all the furniture out of the room, just try to get it to the center of the room and give it 4 feet away from the walls if you got a cut in your ceiling and you need a ladder to do so.\\n6: so step number 2 is you're going to gather all your supplies together once I get myself some working space in this room.\\n7: I was able to get everything out of this room.\\n8: that wasn't very much stuff, so I got myself a good clean room with no furniture in it.\\n9: I'm gonna lay down a drop off and that's going to be.\\n10: we're going to begin laying out.\\n11: I used to fly so I can begin working.\\n12: I'm going to set it dropped off now.\\n13: that's where my things going to go and all my do list is that I want to get any paint on the carpet.\\n14: then I'm going to begin the next step.\\n15: so in order to begin this painting process, you want to have some good quality painting tools.\\n16: I'll get all my tool together instead of dropped off down and begin covering this whole entire room with drop off with a good massive drop tub.\\n17: but I start off.\\n18: there's a few essential tools you're going to need is what is the cutting bucket with the roller and a brush?\\n19: I've got myself this.\\n20: I like a 2 gallon common bucket.\\n21: I just use a 1 gallon would rid and kind of bucket.\\n22: I like a 3 inch angle bristle brush right here to do all my painting with.\\n23: on the interior painting I used a 4 inch roller with a 3/8 inch nap.\\n24: that's my cutting set up on a small room like this.\\n25: I don't need a really large roller like an 18 inch level, or I could just use a 9 inch lower.\\n26: so got myself a 9 inch pan with just a throwing liner.\\n27: I'll have to worry about cleaning by pan.\\n28: got myself a nine inch roller with a 3/8 reading Finch nap nest cover on there.\\n29: get some holes in the walls.\\n30: I'm going to be tackling the holes in the walls there.\\n31: I got a hand master right here with one-inch tape and nine inch paper that we're going to be running around to protect our floors and protect our blinds and stuff with the taper to be using that.\\n32: use frog tape a lot now.\\n33: use 3m, 20, 21 inch tape on my interior master got ourself a baffle- nice to cycle any of the hole.\\n34: got a flathead screwdriver because it got bigger the switchblade.\\n35: I'm going to be popping my trim, doing our cocking method.\\n36: I'll be using a caulking gun here.\\n37: you got wood rims.\\n38: they're not going to be doing any.\\n39: any the talking of the wood trim, so we're just going to be using cloth tape.\\n40: but a lot of times we're using a caulking gun.\\n41: we've got a lot of drop cloth, but use the plastic runners and the actual camera style drop off nothing.\\n42: your enemies is a ladder.\\n43: so that's kind of some of the basic tools.\\n44: I also keep myself a razor knife or snap knife because if there's any furniture in here we want to cover it with plastic which is 9 by 4 out of plastic.\\n45: always got myself a five in one tool so I can open the panes and do any scraping if I drink to, and then it typically carried around a duster brush just to dust off the baseboards, tops of the, the door jams and window trim.\\n46: then I use myself a pair of rubber gloves that I'm getting paint out of my hand.\\n47: so there you have a clear, some of the essential tools, all the tools and accessories that I've used and like.\\n48: I keep them down from the video description.\\n49: he's always flying it down there.\\n50: so check out the video description or you can find them on my tool store at the.\\n51: I hope you, but here we go.\\n52: let's get going to the next step.\\n53: so step number three, with getting utters drop off all day now, got them all the way down to this floor the best we can, as we have any furniture where turnout.\\n54: so we got them all laid out.\\n55: now.\\n56: step number four is not seeing the rhythm.\\n57: we're going to use the nine inch taper twice.\\n58: take the master out our baseboard to give a little added protection, for anything with the baseboards are the rocks on top opposed to the base work.\\n59: we need to put in some masking on our window sills and they're going to roll for our blind run.\\n60: a piece of mass goes over the top of those blinds, so no, Kate will drip on most.\\n61: it's a big void our ceiling.\\n62: so we sucked this process.\\n63: this is denim whore.\\n64: it's part of step number four.\\n65: we're going to run around or one-inch Kate with that.\\n66: our drop-off down got a masking paper down.\\n67: we're going to about one is tape along our baseboards, door trim and a window trim.\\n68: so what's step will report them.\\n69: I'm going to move on to step notify and that's removing switched lengths and tackling the holes in the wall.\\n70: we got switch lights right here to want to remove all these switch lanes.\\n71: the very simple debris will remove.\\n72: I'm just using a flathead screwdriver just going to remove the switch plate, put it in a bucket, that way we can paint around it.\\n73: you know what I find?\\n74: remnants, which slaves.\\n75: so nothing ready to do this baffling.\\n76: just a few holes up here.\\n77: got some lightweight spackling and a

development knife wipe around it is good.\\n82: I really thought through what separates the dry spouses, this room.\\n83: that would take me more than four hours to paint this room so I got to have a

tone.\\n87: we don't want to be really heavy things, we want it to drive really fast.\\n88: we get the heat turned up, we're going to get what we call it skin clothes on gear and our final coat, well, VI heavies go.\\n89: so here we go with the first count, step number six.\\n90: so we're kind of skin tone, we brighter out, given hope this thing.\\n91: it's going to dry.\\n92: really, what's that dry?\\n93: we begin our cutting process: to be cut in the ceiling.\\n94: you cut in the corner.\\n95: I'm going to roll around our switch plates, light switches, and then we'll be doing our cut ends along our baseboards and trim in wall.\\n96: that's lap.\\n97: then you go over it with your second color.\\n98: so step number seven is doing our cut in.\\n99: so here we go, you might as well be doing our cut in and we're going to start stat number eight now and that's rolling our second coat on our wall.\\n100: and this is.\\n101: there's a lot of different ways you can do this and just depends on how many people you have working with you, if you're by yourself, or if you've got wood trim, that's, or or you got painted signatures- talking, until there's a lot of different nothing.\\n102: they've got a bunch of different videos out there showing you different methods of doing this.\\n103: on this, right here, we got Woodson, we're not talking, and we just have to take right up next to the wood trim.\\n104: so we're doing our cut in and then you're going back and rolling our second coat.\\n105: so we applied the second photo right now.\\n106: okay, this is how many grow walls out if you want to roll the wall box using eighteen inch roller.\\n107: so now I'm going to step number nine, that's holding this Basking.\\n108: once again, this is a crucial step.\\n109: you don't want to let your paint or caulking and paint dry.\\n110: so I'm going to begin pulling all this, all the masking, off, that number nine, and I'm working in this zoom by myself right now.\\n111: so I'm just going to pull up this, this section, right here now.\\n112: the final step, step number 10, is doing the touch-ups and clean up.\\n113: I'm going to begin clanging all their stuff up, but before I clean it up, I got two coats on all I know that's good and done.\\n114: like do I try to get my cut in all around my doors, windows, baseboards and ceilings- often one tunnel

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhi, my fiddle is 5 feet but its got no branches?! how  do i get it to grow branches? thanks\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: so yeah, here we are again.\\n1: if you know me, you know I love taking care of some fiddly FIGS.\\n2: I love being stressed out.\\n3: I love being concerned every single day whether or not they're going to stay alive or if they're gonna die on me.\\n4: I'd really love that.\\n5: no, I'm joking, I don't love that.\\n6: it's so stressful.\\n7: the fiddly think is the most finicky plant I've ever owned and I'm sure you feel the same way.\\n8: so why are we still trying to keep them in our homes?\\n9: I mean, come on, I know why.\\n10: because they're so darn gorgeous.\\n11: what a wonderful plant, right, great foliage tree like shape.\\n12: you have a tree in your home.\\n13: you have a tree house.\\n14: many of us still have issues in how to keep them healthy.\\n15: so this is the relief: a care 2.0.\\n16: I sent out a post asking for your questions again on how to help you get your fiddly fig back on track.\\n17: so here are the answers to your top 5 questions.\\n18: so one: what exactly are you doing?\\n19: are you over warding or you underwater?\\n20: you can tell this based on a look of your leaves: yellow leaves can be a sign of over watering.\\n21: so if you start to see this, check the base of the pot to make sure your plant isn't sitting in water and second, start to water less.\\n22: yellowing leaves can also be an old leaf dying off to give room to new growth.\\n23: brown spots will they're an indication of under watering or, better yet, inconsistent watering.\\n24: to avoid this, make sure you're awarding your fiddle only when the top 2 inches of soil are dry to the touch.\\n25: take your finger and stick it in the dirt and do a test.\\n26: if the dirt just falls off of your finger, it's time to water.\\n27: if it's still a little muddy and sticks to your finger, well then I'd wait.\\n28: so you want to make sure you're watering your fiddle so that all of the water goes through the drainage hole and then it sits in the base tray.\\n29: once you see that happen, you want to let the water in the base tray sit there for about fifteen to twenty minutes, or take the base tray and toss all of that runoff water.\\n30: now, if the pot is too heavy for you to move off the base tray, what I consider is grabbing a towel, placing it around the base tray and letting that towel suck up all that runoff water.\\n31: I tend to water my fiddles every seven days, but I always make sure to do the finger test before I do so.\\n32: second, let's talk about light.\\n33: my fiddles have been living their best life in bright indirect light.\\n34: these windows here are north east facing and each are 8 by 4 feet in size, and I never close the blinds, so I have the luxury of having a lot of light.\\n35: many of you might not have this sort of setting, so you're gonna see different results.\\n36: if you don't get much light, you won't have a successful fiddle this little.\\n37: here is one I rescue from a resturant in town and you can see here how it look.\\n38: just a year ago, before I moved it into this room, they had it in the dock area of their restaurant and when I took it from them it had about seven leaves left and two completely dead branches.\\n39: I mean, now look at it.\\n40: great light and consistent care will do this.\\n41: it's not so well that now it starts to develop really large leaves as it grew, which has made it top-heavy.\\n42: once this starts to happen, you have to find a way to anchor it so that it doesn't continue to grow and fall over.\\n43: I use the invisible hanging wire in a staple gun: a staple one into the wall and tie the other to the branch of the fiddle.\\n44: this is how I keep the limbs of my fiddle, Frank, all in view of the light and why he had the shape he does.\\n45: third, when a filthy fig is doing its best, it'll start to create new branches on its own, but sometimes you want to encourage that yourself.\\n46: if you look at the branch of your fiddle from the base to the tip of the new growth, you'll see a change in the look of the branch.\\n47: that the base is hard and brown like a tree, but as you get closer to the new growth it starts to look more green, more alive.\\n48: in.\\n49: the green area of the branch is where you want to cut the branch to encourage it to split into two new branches.\\n50: you can see here how the farm cut the branch and it's split into more branches.\\n51: I tried it here on my small fiddle and it split into two new branches.\\n52: this is made easier when your fiddle is anywhere between three to five feet in height.\\n53: but if you have one long branch like the fiddle here, I wouldn't really suggest it forth.\\n54: this particular fiddle started one all on its own at the very top, but it being an already top-heavy, I had move the branch by cutting it where was still green.\\n55: this will now allow me to propagate the cutting by placing it in tap water and waiting for it to develop roots.\\n56: it works best when it's in bright indirect light, not direct sunlight.\\n57: this could take weeks, but if you're patient it will happen.\\n58: lastly, if you fiddle hasn't grown in the last six months, then I would say that there is an issue.\\n59: I would suggest the following: repot your fiddle.\\n60: give it more room for the roots to spread its arms,

thanks\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: so yeah, here we are again.\\n1: if you know me, you know I love taking care of some fiddly FIGS.\\n2: I love being stressed out.\\n3: I love being concerned every single day whether or not they're going to stay alive or if they're gonna die on me.\\n4: I'd really love that.\\n5: no, I'm joking, I don't love that.\\n6: it's so stressful.\\n7: the fiddly think is the most finicky plant I've ever owned and I'm sure you feel the same way.\\n8: so why are we still trying to keep them in our homes?\\n9: I mean, come on, I know why.\\n10: because they're so darn gorgeous.\\n11: what a wonderful plant, right, great foliage tree like shape.\\n12: you have a tree in your home.\\n13: you have a tree house.\\n14: many of us still have issues in how to keep them healthy.\\n15: so this is the relief: a care 2.0.\\n16: I sent out a post asking for your questions again on how to help you get your fiddly fig back on track.\\n17: so here are the answers to your top 5 questions.\\n18: so one: what exactly are you doing?\\n19: are you over warding or you underwater?\\n20: you can tell this based on a look of your leaves: yellow leaves can be a sign of over watering.\\n21: so if you start to see this, check the base of the pot to make sure your plant isn't sitting in water and second, start to water less.\\n22: yellowing leaves can also be an old leaf dying off to give room to new growth.\\n23: brown spots will they're an indication of under watering or, better yet, inconsistent watering.\\n24: to avoid this, make sure you're awarding your fiddle only when the top 2 inches of soil are dry to the touch.\\n25: take your finger and stick it in the dirt and do a test.\\n26: if the dirt just falls off of your finger, it's time to water.\\n27: if it's still a little muddy and sticks to your finger, well then I'd wait.\\n28: so you want to make sure you're watering your fiddle so that all of the water goes through the drainage hole and then it sits in the base tray.\\n29: once you see that happen, you want to let the water in the base tray sit there for about fifteen to twenty minutes, or take the base tray and toss all of that runoff water.\\n30: now, if the pot is too heavy for you to move off the base tray, what I consider is grabbing a towel, placing it around the base tray and letting that towel suck up all that runoff water.\\n31: I tend to water my fiddles every seven days, but I always make sure to do the finger test before I do so.\\n32: second, let's talk about light.\\n33: my fiddles have been living their best life in bright indirect light.\\n34: these windows here are north east facing and each are 8 by 4 feet in size, and I never close the blinds, so I have the luxury of having a lot of light.\\n35: many of you might not have this sort of setting, so you're gonna see different results.\\n36: if you don't get much light, you won't have a successful fiddle this little.\\n37: here is one I rescue from a resturant in town and you can see here how it look.\\n38: just a year ago, before I moved it into this room, they had it in the dock area of their restaurant and when I took it from them it had about seven leaves left and two completely dead branches.\\n39: I mean, now look at it.\\n40: great light and consistent care will do this.\\n41: it's not so well that now it starts to develop really large leaves as it grew, which has made it top-heavy.\\n42: once this starts to happen, you have to find a way to anchor it so that it doesn't continue to grow and fall over.\\n43: I use the invisible hanging wire in a staple gun: a staple one into the wall and tie the other to the branch of the fiddle.\\n44: this is how I keep the limbs of my fiddle, Frank, all in view of the light and why he had the shape he does.\\n45: third, when a filthy fig is doing its best, it'll start to create new branches on its own, but sometimes you want to encourage that yourself.\\n46: if you look at the branch of your fiddle from the base to the tip of the new growth, you'll see a change in the look of the branch.\\n47: that the base is hard and brown like a tree, but as you get closer to the new growth it starts to look more green, more alive.\\n48: in.\\n49: the green area of the branch is where you want to cut the branch to encourage it to split into two new branches.\\n50: you can see here how the farm cut the branch and it's split into more branches.\\n51: I tried it here on my small fiddle and it split into two new branches.\\n52: this is made easier when your fiddle is anywhere between three to five feet in height.\\n53: but if you have one long branch like the fiddle here, I wouldn't really suggest it forth.\\n54: this particular fiddle started one all on its own at the very top, but it being an already top-heavy, I had move the branch by cutting it where was still green.\\n55: this will now allow me to propagate the cutting by placing it in tap water and waiting for it to develop roots.\\n56: it works best when it's in bright indirect light, not direct sunlight.\\n57: this could take weeks, but if you're patient it will happen.\\n58: lastly, if you fiddle hasn't grown in the last six months, then I would say that there is an issue.\\n59: I would suggest the following: repot your fiddle.\\n60: give it more room for the roots to spread its arms, to maybe try rotating the fiddle.\\n61: rotating the federal every other month encourages all of the branches to get a little bit of the window action.\\n62: and third, I suggest fertilizing your fiddle.\\n63: I fertilize my fiddles throughout spring and summer, every other watering.\\n64: these are always to help encourage your fiddle to grow and be strong and it look beautiful.\\n65: so we're gonna say I love doing this and I hope this really helps you get your fiddly fix back on track, healthy again, so I can alleviate some of the stress that you might have or you might be carrying

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhow did you film the on car pov shots?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: This is a pinewood derby car.\\n1: it comes in a kit, Then you build it and put it together and then it uses gravity to go down a track.\\n2: So over a hundred million of these cars have been built and raised by kids over the past 60 years, which means over 100 million Dads have spent a lot of time at the workbench and then subsequently pretended their kid helped in some Meaningful way.\\n3: But don\\'t feel bad for the boys, because someday they\\'ll grow up to be dads And then they\\'ll get a chance to work on a car of their very own.\\n4: Now this is a much faster pinewood derby car.\\n5: but wait, This was my entry.\\n6: I was disqualified because apparently, using jet propulsion goes against the \"spirit\"\\n7: of the competition.\\n8: This is a much faster, legal car.\\n9: but what is it about this one that makes it so much faster than this one Really?\\n10: is it the wheels?\\n11: is it the weight Placement?\\n12: is it the axles?\\n13: and of the design features that influence speed, which one of those is the most important?\\n14: for example, do Aerodynamics really play a role?\\n15: so today We\\'re gonna use cold hard science to figure out how you can maximize your chance of taking home the trophy With the least amount of effort.\\n16: there are a lot of opinions on how you build a fast car and- spoiler alert- Some of those popular ones are completely false and at the end of the video, to prove science isn\\'t back true, I\\'ll show you a car built in 45 minutes based on what I learned, and then show you how to do Competition.\\n17: so let\\'s start with the fundamentals.\\n18: the pinewood derby is all about Conservation of energy.\\n19: the amount of energy you start the race with, it\\'s the same amount of energy you form the race with.\\n20: it\\'s just A different kind.\\n21: so each of these blocks represents a unit of energy.\\n22: so at the beginning of the race it\\'s all Potential energy, which is the energy associated with height.\\n23: So when you start the height of your center of masses on the track, The more of it you have.\\n24: and then at the end of the race, in a perfect world, all that potential energy Has been converted to kinetic energy.\\n25: block 4 block: the kinetic energy is the energy of speed.\\n26: so you were really high on the track and as you came down, all that height was converted into Speed.\\n27: and you notice- I said in a perfect world, because in reality We lose some of that kinetic energy to friction, its dissipated through heat.\\n28: But you will notice that these two piles of friction and Kinetic energy still add up to the original potential energy We started with.\\n29: Energy is conserved.\\n30: So if you can reduce friction, that means you\\'re going to have more kinetic energy, and that is the key.\\n31: This pile is the key to winning the race because it has the speed term in there, and whoever has the higher Pile of blocks here wins the race every time.\\n32: so for the rest of this video, We\\'re gonna discuss What truly matters and amazing: your kinetic energy or your speed, or this pipe.\\n33: How do you make this pile as big as possible with the least amount of effort?\\n34: okay, So before we go any further, I want to introduce you to someone I met while doing the research for building the perfect powered derby car.\\n35: My name is Scott Act All aerospace.\\n36: about Ten years ago, my son And I my wife\\'s car out of the garage and we converted into the pinewood derby research facility.\\n37: for almost a year we conducted experiments And use the laws of physics to determine exactly what takes make a winning pinewood derby race car.\\n38: what I love about Dr Acton is that, instead of just making blind statements, like 99% of the information you find out there, he used the Scientific method does all the possible parameters that go into building a pinewood derby car.\\n39: and then he documented the results.\\n40: okay, So what did he learn after year of testing?\\n41: so here\\'s a list of seven of the parameters he tested and how many car lengths You would win by if you\\'re able to perfect that specific parameter, assuming everything else was the same.\\n42: So the first thing you should notice is by far the biggest contributor to increasing the speed your car is Maxing out the weight of your car at five ounces and then putting it in the right location towards the rear of the car.\\n43: so that alone contributes to 36% of the speedier car.\\n44: and you would be a car that had the worst possible mass placement location at the very front of the Car, by almost five car lengths, if everything else was identical between your two cars.\\n45: So why is this?\\n46: well, if you put all your weight toward the back of the car like this, when you\\'re sitting on the track, Before you even start, your center of mass is higher up Than if the weight was concentrated at the front of the car.\\n47: that means you automatically start With more potential energy.\\n48: and since energy is conservative, We added two blocks here.\\n49: We have to add two blocks on the other side of the equation, which means you get more kinetic energy and again That\\'s the energy of speed, which means you\\'re going faster when you get to the bottom of the ramp.\\n50: So another way to look at it is to say both cars will roll down the ramp at this same speed Until they get to the bottom.\\n51: now, at this point the blue car is done accelerating, But the red car has all the mass at the back and is still falling and will continue to be pushed forward, sort of giving it a turbo boost when it gets to the platform.\\n52: so now the question remains: how far back should The mass be placed?\\n53: now?\\n54: the mass is too Far back.\\n55: You\\'re Gonna Pop a wheelie and be totally unstable and clearly that\\'s bad.\\n56: so doctor act and ran trials on 40 cars and Concentrated the mass in different locations on the car, and this chart is an example of kind of data that he produced.\\n57: so somewhere around 0.9 to 1.5 inches in front of the rear axle gives you the best times.\\n58: So if you want to narrow it down even more than that, it kind of depends on the shape your car.\\n59: the doctor actually went into more details into this in a video he made.\\n60: it\\'s like 2 hours long.\\n61: it details all the Results of his tests and even shows you like some tips and footage of how to actually fabricate the car.\\n62: So we want a lot more detail than I\\'m giving here.\\n63: I highly recommend you check it out.\\n64: I put a link to it in the description of this video.\\n65: So let\\'s quickly run through the remaining list of the critical parameters: light weighting wheels.\\n66: to give you a two car lengths, We\\'d, everything else being equal, if your race rules allow, you need to take as much weight off this wheel as possible, especially the outer Edge, or just buy some that are done for you, And I put a link of the video description of where you can get some now to explain why this Matters.\\n67: let\\'s go back to our blocks.\\n68: I didn\\'t tell you the full story when it comes to kinetic Energy.\\n69: so remember this is the energy of motion and when you cross the finish, like technically, you have two types of motions.\\n70: your car is translating, but the wheels are also rotating about the axis.\\n71: now that gives us rotational kinetic energy.\\n72: now this green pile of Translating Kinetic energy is still the most important because that represents your cars speed and this orange pile With spinning wheels actually takes away from that.\\n73: So if we can minimize the moment of inertia on each of the wheels by making as light as possible Around the Edge, that means more of our initial potential energy will go into making our car go fast And not just spinning up the wheels with a lot of energy.\\n74: so when you high center at the end the wheels are just spinning Forever.\\n75: that\\'s energy We could have used to make our car Go fast.\\n76: so the most streamlined pinewood derby car is going to be to normal block of wood by about 1.4 Car lengths and everything else is equal.\\n77: now going back to our blocks.\\n78: you\\'re not very aerodynamic.\\n79: It\\'s basically just a form of friction.\\n80: so essentially, the more streamlined your profile is, the fewer air molecules You basically have to push out of the way So you don\\'t have to kill yourself here.\\n81: making some attempt to make the car a little bit more streamlined in the standard block is Gonna be worth it.\\n82: using polished axles will be normal axles by about one point three car lengths, everything else being equal.\\n83: I was actually surprised this wasn\\'t a greater tribute to overall speed, but drak around 35 trials of different Smoothness on the axles and this is what the data show.\\n84: interestingly grooved axles are a complete waste of time and money.\\n85: if you look at the formula for Friction, it really just depends on the Two materials of the services.\\n86: rub it together and sort of the weight at that surface.\\n87: so even if you reduce your surface area by a factor of two, the overall weight acting at those services is the same, so Nothing changes.\\n88: so lifting one wheel on your car, So your cars only riding on three wheels, will be a four wheeled car by about one point one car lengths, Everything else being equal.\\n89: and most people say, oh, it\\'s one less wheel, that\\'s 1/4 the friction.\\n90: But for the reasons we talked about, that\\'s not true, because each wheel just has more weight on and the real reason this actually helps Goes back to our rotational kinetic energy.\\n91: now remember, the green pile is what you want to maximize and if you have one less wheel to get spinning as you start going down the ramp, that means that energy gets to go to our kinetic energy of Translation, which means the Faster velocity at the finish line.\\n92: Finally, adding graphic to your wheels and axles will make your car win by about point nine car lengths- Everything else be equal.\\n93: against the car that has no ground.\\n94: now there are several really expensive graphite solutions out there, but all the extra side pocket basically said Graphite graphite.\\n95: that\\'s Clever marketing.\\n96: our independent tests show that there\\'s really no appreciable difference between one versus another.\\n97: So there\\'s a number of other parameters Dr Act and discusses in his videos, but those six are the ones that will have the biggest impact, Relative at the time you spend on your car.\\n98: so in order to prove that science is true and to show that those six steps Are really the best use of your time, on the day of our big race here, I decided to completely build a car from scratch in about 45 minutes and then take it at the Competition and see how it did.\\n99: so the first thing I did would just make a single cut in this block of wood.\\n100: so remember, Aerodynamics are important, but there\\'s no need to totally kill yourself on it.\\n101: Just a simple reduced shape is good.\\n102: Okay, so the next step is polishing the axle.\\n103: so here\\'s a before and after.\\n104: Basically, you just want to take your axle, put it in a drill press or even a hand drill, and duct tape down the trigger, And then you just take different levels of sandpaper and just different water and put it on the nail.\\n105: Yeah, you go all the way from.\\n106: you know 600 mm Grit.\\n107: the last step should be some sort of polishing compound.\\n108: I put a link to another Youtube video that covers this in a lot more detail in the video description, And then I went ahead and mark the 12 o\\'clock position on the nail head, and this is why.\\n109: So, in doing research, to talking with a bunch of experts, I actually found two things that dr Acton didn\\'t test.\\n110: These are the concept of rail riding and the concept of bending your axles.\\n111: So your wheels are canting, so let\\'s start with bending the axle.\\n112: so to bend the axles, I use this bending tool from dirty work.\\n113: So, right there, you just bend the nail, then you take it out of the clamp and then you have an axle That\\'s been at exactly 2.5 degrees.\\n114: So if you don\\'t want to go to the hassle, you could actually buy pre bent and pre polished axles online.\\n115: I put a link to where you can get them in the video description.\\n116: So bent axles are important for two reasons.\\n117: the first is that it reduces friction, And this is because, as you roll down the track to weigh, the axles are bent, the wheels want to migrate outwards, And that\\'s good, because it reduces friction in the sense that part that\\'s rubbing is The wheel and the nail head, which has a much lower coefficient of friction than if the wheels just bouncing around Rubbing against the wooden body of the car.\\n118: the second reason They\\'re really important is it makes alignment a hundred times easier.\\n119: We\\'ll get to that in a minute.\\n120: and now I just put the wheels on the car And this is a good time to apply the graphite.\\n121: just get it everywhere You really can\\'t over apply it.\\n122: and now, because I\\'m going our car to only write on three wheels, I Deepen one side of the pre-cut axle groove in the front and now, because it\\'s deeper, that front left wheel won\\'t touch the ground.\\n123: so Now, you see, I am just pushing these axles in my hand.\\n124: I mean, there are tools that sell for like ninety dollars that help you align them, and people talk about drilling.\\n125: the hole is just Perpendicular.\\n126: but it really doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re using cannon axles.\\n127: You just kind of put them in the pre-made slots And then afterwards I just use a screwdriver just to make sure the nails were actually flush in each of those slots.\\n128: And it doesn\\'t matter because with the cannon axles you can align it later.\\n129: So this is where it leaves us at the front and left wheels rates it up off the ground.\\n130: you can see the back two Wheels, or can it outwards, but you notice the front wheel is actually candid the opposite Direction.\\n131: This is the other thing drak that didn\\'t look at, but it was called the rail righty technique.\\n132: now rail riding means you Intentionally steer your car into the rail that runs down the track and guides your car.\\n133: now That sounds crazy, like it\\'s totally going to increase your friction and a lot of experts recommend spending Hours and hours on a line of your car so it runs perfectly straight.\\n134: so the problem with that is: no track has a perfect surface, so even the Perfectly aligned car is going to bounce around on the track.\\n135: So these bounces are incredibly detrimental because with each impact you\\'re taking some of your kinetic energy And it\\'s being converted to friction and heat Again.\\n136: Kinetic Energy in this pile are the key to winning the race.\\n137: so watch this slow-mo video of this rail rider car I\\'ve built.\\n138: this is another car that actually ran pretty straight on a normal flat surface.\\n139: So the key to the rail rider car is it turns toward the center rail, but just barely enough, So it maintains contact with the rail.\\n140: So here\\'s that.\\n141: you set up the rail rider.\\n142: so get yourself a nice flat board That\\'s about 4 to 6 feet long and your car should be r about 1 inch toward the side.\\n143: that has the wheel raised The length of that board.\\n144: so in this case it beer too much.\\n145: and this is the genius of the ben taxes, Because to change direction We don\\'t have to shim or glue.\\n146: All you do is twist the Nailhead.\\n147: It doesn\\'t take much, And then once I did that it was just about right.\\n148: So once again, if you want more information on the rail riding alignment process, I put a link in the video description That goes into a lot more depth.\\n149: And then you also want to check the rear wheels just to make sure they are migrating outwards.\\n150: You should see a little daylight between the wheel and the car body.\\n151: and then again, if they\\'re not, all you have to do is get some pliers and twist the head of the axle and So the final step in just getting our center of mass in the right spot.\\n152: So I measure an inch in front of the rear axle and then just to prove that ghetto is perfectly fine, here I\\'m using duct tape, and then you just kind of balance it on that line that We drew.\\n153: you probably never get the balance exact, But you just do enough to convince yourself that it\\'s more or less in the right spot.\\n154: now There are actually some pinewood derby racing leagues held on the monthly basis for adults across the country.\\n155: so I asked a few the experts Who run them.\\n156: what do all the winning cars have in common?\\n157: and the reason I took the two additional concept of the rail rider And the canted wheel seriously is because they told me all of the cars that not only win But are in turn have three things in common: They all right on three wheels and not four, They all rail ride and they all have canted wheels.\\n158: So at the race, my buddy Mason won first place with an undefeated record in a field of 20 cars.\\n159: he even beat my 40 mile an hour rocket car, Although that probably had more to do the fact that my dumb friend Troy sabotage my firing mechanism.\\n160: Oh so the rematch.\\n161: I would straight for the jugular.\\n162: Now Mason told me they spent at least 12 hours building this park, focusing on the huge list of things that\\'s Supposable you have to do everything for, and I have the fastest car.\\n163: now, after the race I asked to borrow his card once everybody Left.\\n164: I did a couple test runs: his undefeated 12-hour car against my 45-minute car and this is the result: in fact, my 45-minute car Beardloss of this car of my buddies And he\\'s like an expert racer.\\n165: in fact, this exact car has won many races, even the district level.\\n166: okay.\\n167: so in summary, I recommend maximizing the way to your car at five ounces and Placing it in the correct spot on the car, about an inch in front of the rear axles.\\n168: Have a reasonably aerodynamic car and have it right on three wheels- Lightweight those wheels if your race rules allow it, and then get the been polished axle So you could reduce your friction, make it a lot easier to align and you can implement the rail riding technique And then just run your rail rider alignment test and make sure you use plenty of graphite.\\n169: So make sure you check out the links in the description for more detail on some of the steps I didn\\'t cover.\\n170: folie plus: if you want to save yourself a little time, I have some links there that show you where you get some of this stuff pre-made, like the bent polished axles.\\n171: So this video is way longer than I typically like to make

wait, This was my entry.\\n6: I was disqualified because apparently, using jet propulsion goes against the \"spirit\"\\n7: of the competition.\\n8: This is a much faster, legal car.\\n9: but what is it about this one that makes it so much faster than this one Really?\\n10: is it the wheels?\\n11: is it the weight Placement?\\n12: is it the axles?\\n13: and of the design features that influence speed, which one of those is the most important?\\n14: for example, do Aerodynamics really play a role?\\n15: so today We\\'re gonna use cold hard science to figure out how you can maximize your chance of taking home the trophy With the least amount of effort.\\n16: there are a lot of opinions on how you build a fast car and- spoiler alert- Some of those popular ones are completely false and at the end of the video, to prove science isn\\'t back true, I\\'ll show you a car built in 45 minutes based on what I learned, and then show you how to do Competition.\\n17: so let\\'s start with the fundamentals.\\n18: the pinewood derby is all about Conservation of energy.\\n19: the amount of energy you start the race with, it\\'s the same amount of energy you form the race with.\\n20: it\\'s just A different kind.\\n21: so each of these blocks represents a unit of energy.\\n22: so at the beginning of the race it\\'s all Potential energy, which is the energy associated with height.\\n23: So when you start the height of your center of masses on the track, The more of it you have.\\n24: and then at the end of the race, in a perfect world, all that potential energy Has been converted to kinetic energy.\\n25: block 4 block: the kinetic energy is the energy of speed.\\n26: so you were really high on the track and as you came down, all that height was converted into Speed.\\n27: and you notice- I said in a perfect world, because in reality We lose some of that kinetic energy to friction, its dissipated through heat.\\n28: But you will notice that these two piles of friction and Kinetic energy still add up to the original potential energy We started with.\\n29: Energy is conserved.\\n30: So if you can reduce friction, that means you\\'re going to have more kinetic energy, and that is the key.\\n31: This pile is the key to winning the race because it has the speed term in there, and whoever has the higher Pile of blocks here wins the race every time.\\n32: so for the rest of this video, We\\'re gonna discuss What truly matters and amazing: your kinetic energy or your speed, or this pipe.\\n33: How do you make this pile as big as possible with the least amount of effort?\\n34: okay, So before we go any further, I want to introduce you to someone I met while doing the research for building the perfect powered derby car.\\n35: My name is Scott Act All aerospace.\\n36: about Ten years ago, my son And I my wife\\'s car out of the garage and we converted into the pinewood derby research facility.\\n37: for almost a year we conducted experiments And use the laws of physics to determine exactly what takes make a winning pinewood derby race car.\\n38: what I love about Dr Acton is that, instead of just making blind statements, like 99% of the information you find out there, he used the Scientific method does all the possible parameters that go into building a pinewood derby car.\\n39: and then he documented the results.\\n40: okay, So what did he learn after year of testing?\\n41: so here\\'s a list of seven of the parameters he tested and how many car lengths You would win by if you\\'re able to perfect that specific parameter, assuming everything else was the same.\\n42: So the first thing you should notice is by far the biggest contributor to increasing the speed your car is Maxing out the weight of your car at five ounces and then putting it in the right location towards the rear of the car.\\n43: so that alone contributes to 36% of the speedier car.\\n44: and you would be a car that had the worst possible mass placement location at the very front of the Car, by almost five car lengths, if everything else was identical between your two cars.\\n45: So why is this?\\n46: well, if you put all your weight toward the back of the car like this, when you\\'re sitting on the track, Before you even start, your center of mass is higher up Than if the weight was concentrated at the front of the car.\\n47: that means you automatically start With more potential energy.\\n48: and since energy is conservative, We added two blocks here.\\n49: We have to add two blocks on the other side of the equation, which means you get more kinetic energy and again That\\'s the energy of speed, which means you\\'re going faster when you get to the bottom of the ramp.\\n50: So another way to look at it is to say both cars will roll down the ramp at this same speed Until they get to the bottom.\\n51: now, at this point the blue car is done accelerating, But the red car has all the mass at the back and is still falling and will continue to be pushed forward, sort of giving it a turbo boost when it gets to the platform.\\n52: so now the question remains: how far back should The mass be placed?\\n53: now?\\n54: the mass is too Far back.\\n55: You\\'re Gonna Pop a wheelie and be totally unstable and clearly that\\'s bad.\\n56: so doctor act and ran trials on 40 cars and Concentrated the mass in different locations on the car, and this chart is an example of kind of data that he produced.\\n57: so somewhere around 0.9 to 1.5 inches in front of the rear axle gives you the best times.\\n58: So if you want to narrow it down even more than that, it kind of depends on the shape your car.\\n59: the doctor actually went into more details into this in a video he made.\\n60: it\\'s like 2 hours long.\\n61: it details all the Results of his tests and even shows you like some tips and footage of how to actually fabricate the car.\\n62: So we want a lot more detail than I\\'m giving here.\\n63: I highly recommend you check it out.\\n64: I put a link to it in the description of this video.\\n65: So let\\'s quickly run through the remaining list of the critical parameters: light weighting wheels.\\n66: to give you a two car lengths, We\\'d, everything else being equal, if your race rules allow, you need to take as much weight off this wheel as possible, especially the outer Edge, or just buy some that are done for you, And I put a link of the video description of where you can get some now to explain why this Matters.\\n67: let\\'s go back to our blocks.\\n68: I didn\\'t tell you the full story when it comes to kinetic Energy.\\n69: so remember this is the energy of motion and when you cross the finish, like technically, you have two types of motions.\\n70: your car is translating, but the wheels are also rotating about the axis.\\n71: now that gives us rotational kinetic energy.\\n72: now this green pile of Translating Kinetic energy is still the most important because that represents your cars speed and this orange pile With spinning wheels actually takes away from that.\\n73: So if we can minimize the moment of inertia on each of the wheels by making as light as possible Around the Edge, that means more of our initial potential energy will go into making our car go fast And not just spinning up the wheels with a lot of energy.\\n74: so when you high center at the end the wheels are just spinning Forever.\\n75: that\\'s energy We could have used to make our car Go fast.\\n76: so the most streamlined pinewood derby car is going to be to normal block of wood by about 1.4 Car lengths and everything else is equal.\\n77: now going back to our blocks.\\n78: you\\'re not very aerodynamic.\\n79: It\\'s basically just a form of friction.\\n80: so essentially, the more streamlined your profile is, the fewer air molecules You basically have to push out of the way So you don\\'t have to kill yourself here.\\n81: making some attempt to make the car a little bit more streamlined in the standard block is Gonna be worth it.\\n82: using polished axles will be normal axles by about one point three car lengths, everything else being equal.\\n83: I was actually surprised this wasn\\'t a greater tribute to overall speed, but drak around 35 trials of different Smoothness on the axles and this is what the data show.\\n84: interestingly grooved axles are a complete waste of time and money.\\n85: if you look at the formula for Friction, it really just depends on the Two materials of the services.\\n86: rub it together and sort of the weight at that surface.\\n87: so even if you reduce your surface area by a factor of two, the overall weight acting at those services is the same, so Nothing changes.\\n88: so lifting one wheel on your car, So your cars only riding on three wheels, will be a four wheeled car by about one point one car lengths, Everything else being equal.\\n89: and most people say, oh, it\\'s one less wheel, that\\'s 1/4 the friction.\\n90: But for the reasons we talked about, that\\'s not true, because each wheel just has more weight on and the real reason this actually helps Goes back to our rotational kinetic energy.\\n91: now remember, the green pile is what you want to maximize and if you have one less wheel to get spinning as you start going down the ramp, that means that energy gets to go to our kinetic energy of Translation, which means the Faster velocity at the finish line.\\n92: Finally, adding graphic to your wheels and axles will make your car win by about point nine car lengths- Everything else be equal.\\n93: against the car that has no ground.\\n94: now there are several really expensive graphite solutions out there, but all the extra side pocket basically said Graphite graphite.\\n95: that\\'s Clever marketing.\\n96: our independent tests show that there\\'s really no appreciable difference between one versus another.\\n97: So there\\'s a number of other parameters Dr Act and discusses in his videos, but those six are the ones that will have the biggest impact, Relative at the time you spend on your car.\\n98: so in order to prove that science is true and to show that those six steps Are really the best use of your time, on the day of our big race here, I decided to completely build a car from scratch in about 45 minutes and then take it at the Competition and see how it did.\\n99: so the first thing I did would just make a single cut in this block of wood.\\n100: so remember, Aerodynamics are important, but there\\'s no need to totally kill yourself on it.\\n101: Just a simple reduced shape is good.\\n102: Okay, so the next step is polishing the axle.\\n103: so here\\'s a before and after.\\n104: Basically, you just want to take your axle, put it in a drill press or even a hand drill, and duct tape down the trigger, And then you just take different levels of sandpaper and just different water and put it on the nail.\\n105: Yeah, you go all the way from.\\n106: you know 600 mm Grit.\\n107: the last step should be some sort of polishing compound.\\n108: I put a link to another Youtube video that covers this in a lot more detail in the video description, And then I went ahead and mark the 12 o\\'clock position on the nail head, and this is why.\\n109: So, in doing research, to talking with a bunch of experts, I actually found two things that dr Acton didn\\'t test.\\n110: These are the concept of rail riding and the concept of bending your axles.\\n111: So your wheels are canting, so let\\'s start with bending the axle.\\n112: so to bend the axles, I use this bending tool from dirty work.\\n113: So, right there, you just bend the nail, then you take it out of the clamp and then you have an axle That\\'s been at exactly 2.5 degrees.\\n114: So if you don\\'t want to go to the hassle, you could actually buy pre bent and pre polished axles online.\\n115: I put a link to where you can get them in the video description.\\n116: So bent axles are important for two reasons.\\n117: the first is that it reduces friction, And this is because, as you roll down the track to weigh, the axles are bent, the wheels want to migrate outwards, And that\\'s good, because it reduces friction in the sense that part that\\'s rubbing is The wheel and the nail head, which has a much lower coefficient of friction than if the wheels just bouncing around Rubbing against the wooden body of the car.\\n118: the second reason They\\'re really important is it makes alignment a hundred times easier.\\n119: We\\'ll get to that in a minute.\\n120: and now I just put the wheels on the car And this is a good time to apply the graphite.\\n121: just get it everywhere You really can\\'t over apply it.\\n122: and now, because I\\'m going our car to only write on three wheels, I Deepen one side of the pre-cut axle groove in the front and now, because it\\'s deeper, that front left wheel won\\'t touch the ground.\\n123: so Now, you see, I am just pushing these axles in my hand.\\n124: I mean, there are tools that sell for like ninety dollars that help you align them, and people talk about drilling.\\n125: the hole is just Perpendicular.\\n126: but it really doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re using cannon axles.\\n127: You just kind of put them in the pre-made slots And then afterwards I just use a screwdriver just to make sure the nails were actually flush in each of those slots.\\n128: And it doesn\\'t matter because with the cannon axles you can align it later.\\n129: So this is where it leaves us at the front and left wheels rates it up off the ground.\\n130: you can see the back two Wheels, or can it outwards, but you notice the front wheel is actually candid the opposite Direction.\\n131: This is the other thing drak that didn\\'t look at, but it was called the rail righty technique.\\n132: now rail riding means you Intentionally steer your car into the rail that runs down the track and guides your car.\\n133: now That sounds crazy, like it\\'s totally going to increase your friction and a lot of experts recommend spending Hours and hours on a line of your car so it runs perfectly straight.\\n134: so the problem with that is: no track has a perfect surface, so even the Perfectly aligned car is going to bounce around on the track.\\n135: So these bounces are incredibly detrimental because with each impact you\\'re taking some of your kinetic energy And it\\'s being converted to friction and heat Again.\\n136: Kinetic Energy in this pile are the key to winning the race.\\n137: so watch this slow-mo video of this rail rider car I\\'ve built.\\n138: this is another car that actually ran pretty straight on a normal flat surface.\\n139: So the key to the rail rider car is it turns toward the center rail, but just barely enough, So it maintains contact with the rail.\\n140: So here\\'s that.\\n141: you set up the rail rider.\\n142: so get yourself a nice flat board That\\'s about 4 to 6 feet long and your car should be r about 1 inch toward the side.\\n143: that has the wheel raised The length of that board.\\n144: so in this case it beer too much.\\n145: and this is the genius of the ben taxes, Because to change direction We don\\'t have to shim or glue.\\n146: All you do is twist the Nailhead.\\n147: It doesn\\'t take much, And then once I did that it was just about right.\\n148: So once again, if you want more information on the rail riding alignment process, I put a link in the video description That goes into a lot more depth.\\n149: And then you also want to check the rear wheels just to make sure they are migrating outwards.\\n150: You should see a little daylight between the wheel and the car body.\\n151: and then again, if they\\'re not, all you have to do is get some pliers and twist the head of the axle and So the final step in just getting our center of mass in the right spot.\\n152: So I measure an inch in front of the rear axle and then just to prove that ghetto is perfectly fine, here I\\'m using duct tape, and then you just kind of balance it on that line that We drew.\\n153: you probably never get the balance exact, But you just do enough to convince yourself that it\\'s more or less in the right spot.\\n154: now There are actually some pinewood derby racing leagues held on the monthly basis for adults across the country.\\n155: so I asked a few the experts Who run them.\\n156: what do all the winning cars have in common?\\n157: and the reason I took the two additional concept of the rail rider And the canted wheel seriously is because they told me all of the cars that not only win But are in turn have three things in common: They all right on three wheels and not four, They all rail ride and they all have canted wheels.\\n158: So at the race, my buddy Mason won first place with an undefeated record in a field of 20 cars.\\n159: he even beat my 40 mile an hour rocket car, Although that probably had more to do the fact that my dumb friend Troy sabotage my firing mechanism.\\n160: Oh so the rematch.\\n161: I would straight for the jugular.\\n162: Now Mason told me they spent at least 12 hours building this park, focusing on the huge list of things that\\'s Supposable you have to do everything for, and I have the fastest car.\\n163: now, after the race I asked to borrow his card once everybody Left.\\n164: I did a couple test runs: his undefeated 12-hour car against my 45-minute car and this is the result: in fact, my 45-minute car Beardloss of this car of my buddies And he\\'s like an expert racer.\\n165: in fact, this exact car has won many races, even the district level.\\n166: okay.\\n167: so in summary, I recommend maximizing the way to your car at five ounces and Placing it in the correct spot on the car, about an inch in front of the rear axles.\\n168: Have a reasonably aerodynamic car and have it right on three wheels- Lightweight those wheels if your race rules allow it, and then get the been polished axle So you could reduce your friction, make it a lot easier to align and you can implement the rail riding technique And then just run your rail rider alignment test and make sure you use plenty of graphite.\\n169: So make sure you check out the links in the description for more detail on some of the steps I didn\\'t cover.\\n170: folie plus: if you want to save yourself a little time, I have some links there that show you where you get some of this stuff pre-made, like the bent polished axles.\\n171: So this video is way longer than I typically like to make

in the video description, And then I went ahead and mark the 12 o\\'clock position on the nail head, and this is why.\\n109: So, in doing research, to talking with a bunch of experts, I actually found two things that dr Acton didn\\'t test.\\n110: These are the concept of rail riding and the concept of bending your axles.\\n111: So your wheels are canting, so let\\'s start with bending the axle.\\n112: so to bend the axles, I use this bending tool from dirty work.\\n113: So, right there, you just bend the nail, then you take it out of the clamp and then you have an axle That\\'s been at exactly 2.5 degrees.\\n114: So if you don\\'t want to go to the hassle, you could actually buy pre bent and pre polished axles online.\\n115: I put a link to where you can get them in the video description.\\n116: So bent axles are important for two reasons.\\n117: the first is that it reduces friction, And this is because, as you roll down the track to weigh, the axles are bent, the wheels want to migrate outwards, And that\\'s good, because it reduces friction in the sense that part that\\'s rubbing is The wheel and the nail head, which has a much lower coefficient of friction than if the wheels just bouncing around Rubbing against the wooden body of the car.\\n118: the second reason They\\'re really important is it makes alignment a hundred times easier.\\n119: We\\'ll get to that in a minute.\\n120: and now I just put the wheels on the car And this is a good time to apply the graphite.\\n121: just get it everywhere You really can\\'t over apply it.\\n122: and now, because I\\'m going our car to only write on three wheels, I Deepen one side of the pre-cut axle groove in the front and now, because it\\'s deeper, that front left wheel won\\'t touch the ground.\\n123: so Now, you see, I am just pushing these axles in my hand.\\n124: I mean, there are tools that sell for like ninety dollars that help you align them, and people talk about drilling.\\n125: the hole is just Perpendicular.\\n126: but it really doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re using cannon axles.\\n127: You just kind of put them in the pre-made slots And then afterwards I just use a screwdriver just to make sure the nails were actually flush in each of those slots.\\n128: And it doesn\\'t matter because with the cannon axles you can align it later.\\n129: So this is where it leaves us at the front and left wheels rates it up off the ground.\\n130: you can see the back two Wheels, or can it outwards, but you notice the front wheel is actually candid the opposite Direction.\\n131: This is the other thing drak that didn\\'t look at, but it was called the rail righty technique.\\n132: now rail riding means you Intentionally steer your car into the rail that runs down the track and guides your car.\\n133: now That sounds crazy, like it\\'s totally going to increase your friction and a lot of experts recommend spending Hours and hours on a line of your car so it runs perfectly straight.\\n134: so the problem with that is: no track has a perfect surface, so even the Perfectly aligned car is going to bounce around on the track.\\n135: So these bounces are incredibly detrimental because with each impact you\\'re taking some of your kinetic energy And it\\'s being converted to friction and heat Again.\\n136: Kinetic Energy in this pile are the key to winning the race.\\n137: so watch this slow-mo video of this rail rider car I\\'ve built.\\n138: this is another car that actually ran pretty straight on a normal flat surface.\\n139: So the key to the rail rider car is it turns toward the center rail, but just barely enough, So it maintains contact with the rail.\\n140: So here\\'s that.\\n141: you set up the rail rider.\\n142: so get yourself a nice flat board That\\'s about 4 to 6 feet long and your car should be r about 1 inch toward the side.\\n143: that has the wheel raised The length of that board.\\n144: so in this case it beer too much.\\n145: and this is the genius of the ben taxes, Because to change direction We don\\'t have to shim or glue.\\n146: All you do is twist the Nailhead.\\n147: It doesn\\'t take much, And then once I did that it was just about right.\\n148: So once again, if you want more information on the rail riding alignment process, I put a link in the video description That goes into a lot more depth.\\n149: And then you also want to check the rear wheels just to make sure they are migrating outwards.\\n150: You should see a little daylight between the wheel and the car body.\\n151: and then again, if they\\'re not, all you have to do is get some pliers and twist the head of the axle and So the final step in just getting our center of mass in the right spot.\\n152: So I measure an inch in front of the rear axle and then just to prove that ghetto is perfectly fine, here I\\'m using duct tape, and then you just kind of balance it on that line that We drew.\\n153: you probably never get the balance exact, But you just do enough to convince yourself that it\\'s more or less in the right spot.\\n154: now There are actually some pinewood derby racing leagues held on the monthly basis for adults across the country.\\n155: so I asked a few the experts Who run them.\\n156: what do all the winning cars have in common?\\n157: and the reason I took the two additional concept of the rail rider And the canted wheel seriously is because they told me all of the cars that not only win But are in turn have three things in common: They all right on three wheels and not four, They all rail ride and they all have canted wheels.\\n158: So at the race, my buddy Mason won first place with an undefeated record in a field of 20 cars.\\n159: he even beat my 40 mile an hour rocket car, Although that probably had more to do the fact that my dumb friend Troy sabotage my firing mechanism.\\n160: Oh so the rematch.\\n161: I would straight for the jugular.\\n162: Now Mason told me they spent at least 12 hours building this park, focusing on the huge list of things that\\'s Supposable you have to do everything for, and I have the fastest car.\\n163: now, after the race I asked to borrow his card once everybody Left.\\n164: I did a couple test runs: his undefeated 12-hour car against my 45-minute car and this is the result: in fact, my 45-minute car Beardloss of this car of my buddies And he\\'s like an expert racer.\\n165: in fact, this exact car has won many races, even the district level.\\n166: okay.\\n167: so in summary, I recommend maximizing the way to your car at five ounces and Placing it in the correct spot on the car, about an inch in front of the rear axles.\\n168: Have a reasonably aerodynamic car and have it right on three wheels- Lightweight those wheels if your race rules allow it, and then get the been polished axle So you could reduce your friction, make it a lot easier to align and you can implement the rail riding technique And then just run your rail rider alignment test and make sure you use plenty of graphite.\\n169: So make sure you check out the links in the description for more detail on some of the steps I didn\\'t cover.\\n170: folie plus: if you want to save yourself a little time, I have some links there that show you where you get some of this stuff pre-made, like the bent polished axles.\\n171: So this video is way longer than I typically like to make

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhow do i make 1 of the front wheels ride above the track?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: This is a pinewood derby car.\\n1: it comes in a kit, Then you build it and put it together and then it uses gravity to go down a track.\\n2: So over a hundred million of these cars have been built and raised by kids over the past 60 years, which means over 100 million Dads have spent a lot of time at the workbench and then subsequently pretended their kid helped in some Meaningful way.\\n3: But don\\'t feel bad for the boys, because someday they\\'ll grow up to be dads And then they\\'ll get a chance to work on a car of their very own.\\n4: Now this is a much faster pinewood derby car.\\n5: but wait, This was my entry.\\n6: I was disqualified because apparently, using jet propulsion goes against the \"spirit\"\\n7: of the competition.\\n8: This is a much faster, legal car.\\n9: but what is it about this one that makes it so much faster than this one Really?\\n10: is it the wheels?\\n11: is it the weight Placement?\\n12: is it the axles?\\n13: and of the design features that influence speed, which one of those is the most important?\\n14: for example, do Aerodynamics really play a role?\\n15: so today We\\'re gonna use cold hard science to figure out how you can maximize your chance of taking home the trophy With the least amount of effort.\\n16: there are a lot of opinions on how you build a fast car and- spoiler alert- Some of those popular ones are completely false and at the end of the video, to prove science isn\\'t back true, I\\'ll show you a car built in 45 minutes based on what I learned, and then show you how to do Competition.\\n17: so let\\'s start with the fundamentals.\\n18: the pinewood derby is all about Conservation of energy.\\n19: the amount of energy you start the race with, it\\'s the same amount of energy you form the race with.\\n20: it\\'s just A different kind.\\n21: so each of these blocks represents a unit of energy.\\n22: so at the beginning of the race it\\'s all Potential energy, which is the energy associated with height.\\n23: So when you start the height of your center of masses on the track, The more of it you have.\\n24: and then at the end of the race, in a perfect world, all that potential energy Has been converted to kinetic energy.\\n25: block 4 block: the kinetic energy is the energy of speed.\\n26: so you were really high on the track and as you came down, all that height was converted into Speed.\\n27: and you notice- I said in a perfect world, because in reality We lose some of that kinetic energy to friction, its dissipated through heat.\\n28: But you will notice that these two piles of friction and Kinetic energy still add up to the original potential energy We started with.\\n29: Energy is conserved.\\n30: So if you can reduce friction, that means you\\'re going to have more kinetic energy, and that is the key.\\n31: This pile is the key to winning the race because it has the speed term in there, and whoever has the higher Pile of blocks here wins the race every time.\\n32: so for the rest of this video, We\\'re gonna discuss What truly matters and amazing: your kinetic energy or your speed, or this pipe.\\n33: How do you make this pile as big as possible with the least amount of effort?\\n34: okay, So before we go any further, I want to introduce you to someone I met while doing the research for building the perfect powered derby car.\\n35: My name is Scott Act All aerospace.\\n36: about Ten years ago, my son And I my wife\\'s car out of the garage and we converted into the pinewood derby research facility.\\n37: for almost a year we conducted experiments And use the laws of physics to determine exactly what takes make a winning pinewood derby race car.\\n38: what I love about Dr Acton is that, instead of just making blind statements, like 99% of the information you find out there, he used the Scientific method does all the possible parameters that go into building a pinewood derby car.\\n39: and then he documented the results.\\n40: okay, So what did he learn after year of testing?\\n41: so here\\'s a list of seven of the parameters he tested and how many car lengths You would win by if you\\'re able to perfect that specific parameter, assuming everything else was the same.\\n42: So the first thing you should notice is by far the biggest contributor to increasing the speed your car is Maxing out the weight of your car at five ounces and then putting it in the right location towards the rear of the car.\\n43: so that alone contributes to 36% of the speedier car.\\n44: and you would be a car that had the worst possible mass placement location at the very front of the Car, by almost five car lengths, if everything else was identical between your two cars.\\n45: So why is this?\\n46: well, if you put all your weight toward the back of the car like this, when you\\'re sitting on the track, Before you even start, your center of mass is higher up Than if the weight was concentrated at the front of the car.\\n47: that means you automatically start With more potential energy.\\n48: and since energy is conservative, We added two blocks here.\\n49: We have to add two blocks on the other side of the equation, which means you get more kinetic energy and again That\\'s the energy of speed, which means you\\'re going faster when you get to the bottom of the ramp.\\n50: So another way to look at it is to say both cars will roll down the ramp at this same speed Until they get to the bottom.\\n51: now, at this point the blue car is done accelerating, But the red car has all the mass at the back and is still falling and will continue to be pushed forward, sort of giving it a turbo boost when it gets to the platform.\\n52: so now the question remains: how far back should The mass be placed?\\n53: now?\\n54: the mass is too Far back.\\n55: You\\'re Gonna Pop a wheelie and be totally unstable and clearly that\\'s bad.\\n56: so doctor act and ran trials on 40 cars and Concentrated the mass in different locations on the car, and this chart is an example of kind of data that he produced.\\n57: so somewhere around 0.9 to 1.5 inches in front of the rear axle gives you the best times.\\n58: So if you want to narrow it down even more than that, it kind of depends on the shape your car.\\n59: the doctor actually went into more details into this in a video he made.\\n60: it\\'s like 2 hours long.\\n61: it details all the Results of his tests and even shows you like some tips and footage of how to actually fabricate the car.\\n62: So we want a lot more detail than I\\'m giving here.\\n63: I highly recommend you check it out.\\n64: I put a link to it in the description of this video.\\n65: So let\\'s quickly run through the remaining list of the critical parameters: light weighting wheels.\\n66: to give you a two car lengths, We\\'d, everything else being equal, if your race rules allow, you need to take as much weight off this wheel as possible, especially the outer Edge, or just buy some that are done for you, And I put a link of the video description of where you can get some now to explain why this Matters.\\n67: let\\'s go back to our blocks.\\n68: I didn\\'t tell you the full story when it comes to kinetic Energy.\\n69: so remember this is the energy of motion and when you cross the finish, like technically, you have two types of motions.\\n70: your car is translating, but the wheels are also rotating about the axis.\\n71: now that gives us rotational kinetic energy.\\n72: now this green pile of Translating Kinetic energy is still the most important because that represents your cars speed and this orange pile With spinning wheels actually takes away from that.\\n73: So if we can minimize the moment of inertia on each of the wheels by making as light as possible Around the Edge, that means more of our initial potential energy will go into making our car go fast And not just spinning up the wheels with a lot of energy.\\n74: so when you high center at the end the wheels are just spinning Forever.\\n75: that\\'s energy We could have used to make our car Go fast.\\n76: so the most streamlined pinewood derby car is going to be to normal block of wood by about 1.4 Car lengths and everything else is equal.\\n77: now going back to our blocks.\\n78: you\\'re not very aerodynamic.\\n79: It\\'s basically just a form of friction.\\n80: so essentially, the more streamlined your profile is, the fewer air molecules You basically have to push out of the way So you don\\'t have to kill yourself here.\\n81: making some attempt to make the car a little bit more streamlined in the standard block is Gonna be worth it.\\n82: using polished axles will be normal axles by about one point three car lengths, everything else being equal.\\n83: I was actually surprised this wasn\\'t a greater tribute to overall speed, but drak around 35 trials of different Smoothness on the axles and this is what the data show.\\n84: interestingly grooved axles are a complete waste of time and money.\\n85: if you look at the formula for Friction, it really just depends on the Two materials of the services.\\n86: rub it together and sort of the weight at that surface.\\n87: so even if you reduce your surface area by a factor of two, the overall weight acting at those services is the same, so Nothing changes.\\n88: so lifting one wheel on your car, So your cars only riding on three wheels, will be a four wheeled car by about one point one car lengths, Everything else being equal.\\n89: and most people say, oh, it\\'s one less wheel, that\\'s 1/4 the friction.\\n90: But for the reasons we talked about, that\\'s not true, because each wheel just has more weight on and the real reason this actually helps Goes back to our rotational kinetic energy.\\n91: now remember, the green pile is what you want to maximize and if you have one less wheel to get spinning as you start going down the ramp, that means that energy gets to go to our kinetic energy of Translation, which means the Faster velocity at the finish line.\\n92: Finally, adding graphic to your wheels and axles will make your car win by about point nine car lengths- Everything else be equal.\\n93: against the car that has no ground.\\n94: now there are several really expensive graphite solutions out there, but all the extra side pocket basically said Graphite graphite.\\n95: that\\'s Clever marketing.\\n96: our independent tests show that there\\'s really no appreciable difference between one versus another.\\n97: So there\\'s a number of other parameters Dr Act and discusses in his videos, but those six are the ones that will have the biggest impact, Relative at the time you spend on your car.\\n98: so in order to prove that science is true and to show that those six steps Are really the best use of your time, on the day of our big race here, I decided to completely build a car from scratch in about 45 minutes and then take it at the Competition and see how it did.\\n99: so the first thing I did would just make a single cut in this block of wood.\\n100: so remember, Aerodynamics are important, but there\\'s no need to totally kill yourself on it.\\n101: Just a simple reduced shape is good.\\n102: Okay, so the next step is polishing the axle.\\n103: so here\\'s a before and after.\\n104: Basically, you just want to take your axle, put it in a drill press or even a hand drill, and duct tape down the trigger, And then you just take different levels of sandpaper and just different water and put it on the nail.\\n105: Yeah, you go all the way from.\\n106: you know 600 mm Grit.\\n107: the last step should be some sort of polishing compound.\\n108: I put a link to another Youtube video that covers this in a lot more detail in the video description, And then I went ahead and mark the 12 o\\'clock position on the nail head, and this is why.\\n109: So, in doing research, to talking with a bunch of experts, I actually found

Caption 8 states \"but it\\'s paradise. I took them out of their forms and I painted them and you can, you know, work on sand paper down, make it real pretty to do it if you want.\" Caption 38 states \"you want to have a good plastic consistency to it so you can work with it. Or you can use it in a mold or something, or create something. I put it on paper towels and that will, with wicking, a wicking action that will draw a lot of them moist. You\\'re out of it now. If you want to make some dice for gaming, you can do something like this and cut yourself out a piece of cardboard- this is Center box cardboard that\\'s 4 inches long- and divide it up into 4 inch square and then tape it up so it forms a nice tube and try to get keep it as square as possible. It will make a difference in how the die roll. Now, what\\'s your plastic? Here is a lot of moisture has been. Let\\'s let this sit for about half an hour to get some of the moisture out, to get the bulk of the moisture out. But then you can take that and form it into your mold and you can use anything from old you know cookie cutters. Make yourself up a mold if you want to make something. And there we go, my to dice. My dice are ready to go.\" These captions suggest that the plastic can be worked on and formed into different shapes, and the creator has painted the objects and used molds to create new shapes. Therefore, these captions provide evidence that the plastic can be painted.</s>'},\n",

oh my god.\\n16: this smell looks like they like two Pringles- one of the things that you gotta worry about in a house like this is needles.\\n17: in all honesty, this doesn't surprise me.\\n18: the smell- if you can imagine what the smell is like the bags of rotting food.\\n19: this has to be cleaned out before you can demolish the structure.\\n20: this has to be removed prior to demolition of the entire building for recycling purposes.\\n21: you can't mix construction debris with garbage.\\n22: let's see what else is in here.\\n23: I'm literally standing on three or four feet of garbage.\\n24: this is an 8 foot ceiling.\\n25: I can touch this whole thing right here.\\n26: this is dirty diapers.\\n27: holy crap, I couldn't even find the kitchen.\\n28: you guys wouldn't believe

shifting underneath my weight.\\n45: that probably doesn't help him, can't?\\n46: I feel like gagging, why?\\n47: why do I feel like rotting cans of cat food?\\n48: okay, I'm surprised there isn't any wild animals in here.\\n49: there's got to be rats in here.\\n50: there's gotta be a rats.\\n51: don't scare me.\\n52: we got to get across this moat of diapers.\\n53: no, it's gonna reach up and grab this, the ceiling.\\n54: but the ceiling is covered in feces where they would balance as they were going across.\\n55: I know, literally standing halfway up the refrigerator on garbage, I've just made a discovery: this place still has electricity.\\n56: I would have never imagined that the lights would still be on in this place.\\n57: that means this was recently abandoned.\\n58: just because it's got electricity doesn't make the smell any better, though I heard the refrigerator do.\\n59: I dare.\\n60: no, it's sealed shut with grime.\\n61: oh, here we go.\\n62: here we go.\\n63: okay, I'm sorry.\\n64: sorry, I don't mind, Adam, I don't mind animal waste, but when it comes to human feces- bags of just bags of cigarettes- I gotta be careful touching the ceiling, because the people that lived here before.\\n65: this was the journey they would make every day.\\n66: you got to understand this is how they got around and they were grabbing hold of the ceiling.\\n67: they don't have.\\n68: they don't have access to running water.\\n69: they couldn't have access to running water because when you look at the sink, the sink is full, so they never washed.\\n70: and when they never washed, all their dirty diapers are here.\\n71: they would reach up and grab here to get around.\\n72: and this is literally how they live.\\n73: so this was an everyday journey for them, crawling through the house like this and which I don't understand.\\n74: how could you have adult diapers and be that?\\n75: all right, that's a hallway.\\n76: I'm gonna go see what's in there.\\n77: I know there's a bedroom and I know that's what.\\n78: access to the basement, okay, so this is where they stored their cigarettes.\\n79: how many hours would you sit in this room where the feces?\\n80: the smell of feces in this room is absolutely overpowering?\\n81: this, I assume, is the spot where people would- I I don't know what I'm sitting sitting on, but I know, but it doesn't look pretty.\\n82: I they would actually sit right here.\\n83: this could be the only place in the bathroom and they would smoke cigarettes, because there's a pile right there of cigarettes.\\n84: there's a pile of diapers literally covering the shower door.\\n85: the things I do for you - I'm out of here.\\n86: I just touched the top of the bathroom.\\n87: you wouldn't think that's a big deal, but these people couldn't have washed water wasn't an option in this house, and so they get around by, kept walking, just like I'm walking, and they'd have to grab hold just like this.\\n88: and this whole door top is covered in.\\n89: just use your.\\n90: it's an adventure.\\n91: basement: down we go, down we go.\\n92: smell gets worse.\\n93: nope, really bad bedroom: more diapers rat my

distinct odors coming from it.\\n114: there's in the basement down here there is this distinct oat, musty, moldy alder- which I thought is the worst - but it's also mixed with rotting food that's on the floor.\\n115: but then as I go upstairs it switches.\\n116: it turns to this strong urea order, just like feces.\\n117: so I just stepped on something and it squirted up my leg walking over.\\n118: this is all diapers, but surprisingly solid.\\n119: they finished off all the Pringles.\\n120: dang it.\\n121: no typical clean-out company would base a job like this on time and material.\\n122: how many dumpsters will they need on this site and how many man-hours will it take to do the clean-out on a job like this?\\n123: you can estimate about 70 man-hours and two dumpsters needed.\\n124: so a typical clean-out company would charge around $6,000, but that would not include any hazardous materials.\\n125: now I promised you an insider's tip, so this is how I would do this.\\n126: I would peel the front of the house right off, I would peel the roof of this house right off, and then I would just use my excavator to do all of the cleanup.\\n127: so my guys would have to actually handle very little of this debris themselves now.\\n128: the dumpsters would stay the same, but the time to clean it up would be reduced dramatically, right there?\\n129: oh, just a random bag.\\n130: just a random bag is here.\\n131: all right, I don't know what I'm sitting sitting out, but I know right, I don't know what I'm sitting on- diapers.\\n\\n### Instructions:\\nDetermine if

many dumpsters will they need on this site and how many man-hours will it take to do the clean-out on a job like this?\\n123: you can estimate about 70 man-hours and two dumpsters needed.\\n124: so a typical clean-out company would charge around $6,000, but that would not include any hazardous materials.\\n125: now I promised you an insider\\'s tip, so this is how I would do this.\\n126: I would peel the front of the house right off, I would peel the roof of this house right off, and then I would just use my excavator to do all of the cleanup.\\n127: so my guys would have to actually handle very little of this debris themselves now.\\n128: the dumpsters would stay the same, but the time to clean it up would be reduced dramatically, right there?\\n129: oh, just a random bag.\\n130: just a

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\ni have built a j pole, but am having an issue trying to get the connector to stay on. any suggestions?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: find myself in a happy coincidence: I inherited some scrap copper pipe from a neighbor who's doing a remodel and I have need of a 2 meter amateur radio antenna for a contest this evening.\\n1: so today we're going to build a Jay Paul.\\n2: well, one of the joys of this antenna is that it is dirt simple to make, assuming that you have ever soldered any copper- pretty much anything- before in your life.\\n3: there are lots of good calculators online for what size to make the various pieces of the Jay pole style antenna.\\n4: I'll put a link to the one that I use in the description for the video.\\n5: there's only two things you need to know to plug into one of these calculators.\\n6: one is the frequency that you want the antenna to be optimal for.\\n7: the other is what's called the velocity factor of the material you're making the antenna from.\\n8: and my case I'm custom building this specifically for a 2 meter simplex contest that's going on this evening.\\n9: so I put in one forty six point five megahertz as my frequency to tune for, and the velocity factor sounds complicated, but it's really nothing more than what percentage of the theoretical speed of light does electricity travel in your material?\\n10: copper is a really good conductor.\\n11: so the default of point nine six works pretty well.\\n12: that means from my antenna that I need a quarter wave matching section that is forty nine point one centimeters long- and yes, this is probably going to come out in metric because everything in radio is- and then for my long section I need a hundred and forty seven point four centimeters of length.\\n13: so the good news is that I have lots of choices in this odd shape and my scrap to come up with the little bit less than 50 that I need for the quarter wave.\\n14: but I don't have any pieces in here that are long enough to by themselves be the half wave tall section.\\n15: not to worry, I have here a coupler and as long as we take the length into consideration, the fact that we have a slightly larger diameter for this little piece and a couple more solder joints isn't going to hurt.\\n16: a feel free to splice copper together to make the pieces if you need to.\\n17: even though in my short section my quarter wave matching stub is supposed to be forty nine point one centimeters, I'm going to cut it right here at 30 and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to put a coupler in there and then make the rest of it a second piece of rod.\\n18: I'm going to do that so that I have the easy ability to essentially just insert and remove that top section of the matching stub as a way to tune the, and I have the first two halves of my upright sections here and then I have the bottom all prepped and ready to be soldered, but I'm not quite ready to put the heat to it.\\n19: it's pretty important that the two uprights are in fact parallel.\\n20: so take your time, bust out your tape and make sure that you have these things, you know, parallel, as close as you can get them anyway, before you solder that bottom joint.\\n21: now it's copper.\\n22: it will Bend a little bit once it's stuck together with the solder, but it's better to get it right at this.\\n23: here's the rest of my quarter wave matching stub.\\n24: if I slide that in there and bottom it out, I should have forty nine point one centimeters on this leg.\\n25: I'll be able to make this leg a little bit longer by sliding this thing out if I need to.\\n26: that will tune the antenna down lower, which in this case is probably the direction I want to go, as the simplex frequencies are all at the bottom of the two meter band.\\n27: okay, the rest of my top long section.\\n28: here.\\n29: I know exactly how long I want that to be, that's the one forty seven point four centimeters.\\n30: so in theory I could cut this and solder it in.\\n31: but that assumes that I know to the millimeter, you know how far in this thing is going to go when I solder it, and that it's not going to expand or contract.\\n32: so I'm going to do it in the other order.\\n33: I'm going to solder this in here first and then I'll cut it to length.\\n34: get a piece of solid copper coming out of the middle of my connector.\\n35: heating up the copper and letting the heat flow up into the connector works great.\\n36: okay, got all the pieces done.\\n37: so it's time to cobble this thing together and figure out where on the copper or J section, we are going to attach the connector for the coax.\\n38: I haven't held on there right now with some plastic spring clamps, which aren't the best attachment ever, but the plastic clamps don't interfere with the RF signal pattern.\\n39: it's good enough for testing and it's an easy way for me to be able to move that connection point up and down the antenna until we find the sweet spot.\\n40: what's the sweet spot?\\n41: well, the sweet spot is where we get the lowest SWR standing wave ratio measurement when we transmit a signal into the antenna.\\n42: right up here in the corner I have a handy GoPro cam set up on the SWR meter.\\n43: it's the very, very bottom scale on the meter where the black region starts at zero and goes up to one point five.\\n44: a perfect antenna has an SWR of one to one, meaning 100% of the power that goes to the antenna leaves the antenna.\\n45: so let's key up and do a test on both ends of the amateur two meter band- it's what this is tuned for- and see what kind of deflection we get on this needle.\\n46: two things about a test like this one: even though you're testing, you do need to do eye to stay legal and to always keep your radio on the lowest power available, just in case you hit some sort of a crazy high SWR.\\n47: maybe it's a bad connection, maybe hooked up to the wrong antenna, who knows?\\n48: but you don't want five watts of power coming back at the amp in your radio.\\n49: it's a good way to end up with a new radio.\\n50: for the first test, I'm going to start at the bottom of the ham band, that's 144 megahertz.\\n51: this is n 3 MW V antenna testing.\\n52: okay, that is a pretty incredibly good result.\\n53: that is somewhere in the neighborhood of one to one match.\\n54: let's shoot on up to the other end of the band 147- that 999, whatever megahertz, and see how it looks up there.\\n55: this is n 3 MW v antenna testing.\\n56: okay, once again, the performance is spectacularly good up there.\\n57: I got pretty happy with this.\\n58: I pretty much expected that to be spot-on because, as I mentioned before, the physics of these antennas are pretty well known, and so the online calculator told me where my 50 ohm feed point was going to be, and, sure enough, it's spot-on.\\n59: but if, for whatever reason, you're not getting that good of a match out of this kind of antenna, not to fret.\\n60: this is why we left the connector mobile for the testing.\\n61: just move your attachment point up and down the antenna, repeating your test until you find the spot where you have a really, really good match.\\n62: once you find that spot, you can permanently mount the connector.\\n63: I used a flat piece of copper and just drilled a hole.\\n64: okay, well, as you can see, we have made a transition.\\n65: the antenna is up in the air using duct tape.\\n66: what else would you use?\\n67: what's it?\\n68: attached to a tractor.\\n69: what else would you use?\\n70: well, I hold in my hand a list of amateur radio repeaters in increasing distance from the home

I'll do the four one one thing, so you can at least hear that we are in fact talking to this bugger.\\n80: now, to be fair, I'm no longer on one watt, we're at fifty miles.\\n81: I've cranked this

Captions 8 and 9 provide the answer to this question. Caption 8 states that the recipe calls for both self-raising flour and regular flour, and caption 9 explains that the mixture should not be overmixed to prevent the buns from coming out dry. This suggests that regular flour can be used in place of self-raising flour, but the mixing should be done carefully to ensure the buns turn out correctly.</s>\"},\n",

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nwhile it ripening are you leaving the heat on?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: G'day curd nerds!\\n1: Today we're going to be making cloth banded cheddar, a traditional English cheese from the Somerset area I believe.\\n2: Now, we're going to be following tradition by cloth banding the cheddar, We're not going to be waxing it, which actually increases the flavour of the cheese.\\n3: So we're going to smother on the outside of the cheese some cheesecloth and we're going to put that we're going to put that all over the cheese, and then we're going to smother it in coconut oil.\\n4: Traditionally it's lard, but I don't have any lard handy, but I have found that coconut oil is a good substitute.\\n5: Anyway, on with the cheese.\\n6: The ingredients are 10 litres of full cream milk, an eighth of a teaspoon of Mesophilic culture 2.5 ml or half a teaspoon of calcium chloride 2.5 ml or half a teaspoon of liquid rennet, 12 drops of Annatto and one and a half tablespoons of cheese salt, some cheesecloth, make sure it's an old one, but a clean one, and some lard or coconut oil for banding.\\n7: So going to heat our milk up now.\\n8: I'm using a double boiler and we're going to bring it up to the target temperature.\\n9: The target temperature for this cheese is 31 degrees celsius or 88 fahrenheit Now once at that target temperature, we're going to add our mesophilic culture.\\n10: I'm going to sprinkle that all over the top.\\n11: And we're gonna let that rehydrate for a little bit.\\n12: And then I'm going to stir it in gently.\\n13: I'm going to put the lid on and we're going to allow the milk to acidify or ripen for 40 minutes.\\n14: So 40 minutes later, going to start adding all of the other ingredients.\\n15: So make sure you add these while you're stirring, so firstly the annatto and this gives the cheese a creamier looking consistency or colour.\\n16: So give that a good stir through.\\n17: Now we're gonna add in the calcium chloride.\\n18: Keep stirring, and then we're going to add in the rennet.\\n19: Which is coming up soon.\\n20: Notice that I'm not whipping the milk into a frenzy, we're just stirring that gently so we're not aerating the milk.\\n21: So here's the rennet.\\n22: We're just going to pour that in now while we're stirring and just stir for no longer than one minute.\\n23: And before you pop the lid on make sure the milk has stopped moving.\\n24: So what we're going to do is check for a clean break after 40 minutes, now in this first instance.\\n25: it was a bit of a sloppy break.\\n26: It wasn't as neat as I thought it could be, so I left that for another 10 minutes.\\n27: and then I checked it off-camera, and it was fine after the full 50 minutes.\\n28: So cut the curd into 1.25 centimeter or half inch cubes.\\n29: Just using my trusty curd cutter there and then finishing off the vertical cuts with a knife.\\n30: One way and then the other.\\n31: There we go.\\n32: Now we're going to let the curds heal for 5 minutes.\\n33: So 5 minutes later, I just start stirring.\\n34: I'm going to put the heat back on but we're going to slowly increase the temperature to 39 degrees celsius over the period of 40 minutes.\\n35: So here it is 40 minutes later.\\n36: You see the curds about baked bean size.\\n37: See the annatto starting to kick in there.\\n38: You can see everything's going quite yellow.\\n39: So we're going to start the cheddaring process now.\\n40: Firstly, we allow the curds to settle to the bottom for 40 minutes.\\n41: And then once the 40 minutes has elapsed, we're just going to gently drain off the whey.\\n42: You could keep this for a whey ricotta, but I've already got one in the fridge.\\n43: There's only so much ricotta you can eat.\\n44: There you go, comes out in one big slab, now that's what you're aiming for.\\n45: Now we're going to drain that just gently a little bit and then we're going to pop that back into the pot, because we need to keep the curds warm whilst we're cheddaring.\\n46: So we're going to cut the curd while it's in the pot.\\n47: Just going to cut the curd mass in half, which gives you an approximate, same sort of curd size as they do in the traditional cheddar making process.\\n48: So I'm going to flip over each half for...\\n49: just quickly there if I can stop the pot from moving, there we go...\\n50: So just flip it over, and then I'll let it rest for 10 minutes.\\n51: Now I'm going to transfer this back to the double boiler just to make sure that we can maintain that target temperature of 39 celsius, 102 fahrenheit It does seep out a fair bit of whey, but that's no big deal, just make sure it's covered, so no dust or fluff gets in there.\\n52: Now we're going to do that for 10 minutes.\\n53: So 10 minutes is elapsed, you can see a fair bit of whey has come out.\\n54: Ok so just tip over...\\n55: sorry turn over each slab, and you can see that the curds are shrinking all the time during this process.\\n56: So pop the lid back on and wait for another 10 minutes.\\n57: So 10 minutes is elapsed again.\\n58: So just turn over each half again.\\n59: Pretty easy this cheddaring isn't it!\\n60: Here we go pop the lid back on.\\n61: Then one more time, this final cheddaring turn is for 15 minutes this time, so let's flip it over.\\n62: There we go, pop the lid back on.\\n63: So that's 45 minutes cheddaring time in total.\\n64: So you can see that's how much whey is collected on the bottom of the pot, Then we're just going to drain that whey out now.\\n65: I'm just going to plonk the slabs into the cheesecloth lined colander, then whatever other bits are sitting in the bottom, it's not much.\\n66: It's all good.\\n67: Well so I'm just going to transfer that to a chopping board because we need to cut it down into small fingers of curd.\\n68: So about half an inch, which is 1.25 centimeters, and then cut that in half.\\n69: normally in the cheddar factory there's this big machine it's like a shredder, that does all this for you.\\n70: But seeing as we're at home.\\n71: We have to improvise.\\n72: So I'll just cut it into cubes now.\\n73: Okay, we're going to mill this now.\\n74: So we're just going to break this, each cube in half, as you can see there I've started, and I'll show you the finishing off of the process.\\n75: For those wondering that is an LED light that is in the way.\\n76: I couldn't look through the little viewer.\\n77: But you can see the process.\\n78: We're just cutting each of those in half.\\n79: We've got chunks of curds, so we're going to add in our one and a half tablespoons of salt, and I'm just going to mill that through.\\n80: We just transfer that into our cheesecloth lined cheese basket.\\n81: I'm using a 165 mm basket there, which takes up to 10 litres of milk, or the curds made from 10 litres of milk no problems at all, So just fold the cloth over and pop the follower on top, and I'm going to screw that down to the the pressure for the initial pressing.\\n82: Now if you haven't got a cheese press like this one, just apply the right amount of weight onto your follower.\\n83: So we're going to do it at 11 kilos or 24 lbs for one hour, this is just to form the the cheese initially, you'll see it will have quite a few gaps in the cheese.\\n84: Just make sure it can drain freely, a fair bit of whey's coming off still, creamy at first, but then it goes clear.\\n85: Okay, so an hour has elapsed and we're going to take it out and turn it over.\\n86: just be gentle because it may not have formed properly.\\n87: Still there, a little bit of holes, but now we're going to tighten it all up.\\n88: So we're going to press really heavily, 22 kilos or 50 lbs for 12 hours, just make sure you keep the pressure on, if you've got a spring type like this one, you're going to have to retighten the spring, probably about every 6 hours.\\n89: So really heavy pressure for cheddar, to make sure that all those cubes of curd knit together closely.\\n90: So here I am in my work clothes the next morning, taking the cheese out of the press.\\n91: So it's formed very well.\\n92: And you can see that there's no mechanical holes or anything like that.\\n93: It's all smooth all the way around.\\n94: And we just get a cheese board and mat, pop that on there.\\n95: Now I don't need to brine it, it's already got the salt in it, remembering from the milling stage.\\n96: Now we're going to air dry that for 2 to 3 days.\\n97: And there it is after one day, and there it is after two days.\\n98: Starts to yellow up.\\n99: Now, we're going to cloth band this now.\\n100: We're not going to wax the cheese, I'm going to use the traditional method, so I cut two squares and then one rectangle which is going to be your circumference, There we go.\\n101: Don't mind the hair cut.\\n102: Ok, so that wraps around the circumference, Ok trim that all off, lovely.\\n103: So we coat it with either lard or coconut oil, so I'm using coconut oil here.\\n104: And you just give it an initial coating so that the cheesecloth can stick to it.\\n105: So then you smooth that down as well, just by dabbing your hand in the bowl there and just wiping it all over the cloth, pretty easy to do really.\\n106: So you trim any excess, you just need it neat on top and bottom as well.\\n107: So just make sure you've got that all there.\\n108: Ok, so.\\n109: So that's all done now, I put the top and bottom layer on, just trimming that off, smoothing it down with the coconut oil, the liquid coconut oil.\\n110: So lovely and smooth so nothing can get in.\\n111: So we're going to mature that at 10 degrees celsius or 50 fahrenheit for 3 months minimum.\\n112: Or longer for a sharper cheddar.\\n113: I'm going to mature mine for 6 months.\\n114: So make sure you turn it weekly when it's in the cheese cave.\\n115: So that's what it looks like before we pop it in the cheese cave, we're going to have a taste test obviously in about 6 months' time if you can hang around, and And don't forget to

morning, taking the cheese out of the press.\\n91: So it's formed very well.\\n92: And you can see that there's no mechanical holes or anything like that.\\n93: It's all smooth all the way around.\\n94: And we just get a cheese board and mat, pop that on there.\\n95: Now I don't need to brine it, it's already got the salt in it, remembering from the milling stage.\\n96: Now we're going to air dry that for 2 to 3 days.\\n97: And there it is after one day, and there it is after two days.\\n98: Starts to yellow up.\\n99: Now, we're going to cloth band this now.\\n100: We're not going to wax the cheese, I'm going to use the traditional method, so I cut two squares and then one rectangle which is going to be your circumference, There we go.\\n101: Don't mind the hair cut.\\n102: Ok, so that wraps around the circumference, Ok trim that all off, lovely.\\n103: So we coat it with either lard or coconut oil, so I'm using coconut oil here.\\n104: And you just give it an initial coating so that the cheesecloth can stick to it.\\n105: So then you smooth that down as well, just by dabbing your hand in the bowl there and just wiping it all over the cloth, pretty easy to do really.\\n106: So you trim any excess, you just need it neat on top and bottom as well.\\n107: So just make sure you've got that all there.\\n108: Ok, so.\\n109: So that's all done now, I put the top and bottom layer on, just trimming that off, smoothing it down with the coconut oil, the liquid coconut oil.\\n110: So lovely and smooth so nothing can get in.\\n111: So we're going to mature that at 10 degrees celsius or 50 fahrenheit for 3 months minimum.\\n112: Or longer for a sharper cheddar.\\n113: I'm going to mature mine for 6 months.\\n114: So make sure you turn it weekly when it's in the cheese cave.\\n115: So that's what it looks like before we pop it in the cheese cave, we're going to have a taste test obviously in about 6 months' time if you can hang around, and And don't forget to

answering the question.  Output the numbers of the two most useful captions:\\n\\nThe question asks if the heat is left on while the cheese is ripening. The video captions describe the process of making cloth banded cheddar, from heating the milk to ripening it, adding ingredients, cutting the curds, cheddaring, milling, pressing, and maturing the cheese.\\n\\nThe captions that mention the temperature during the ripening process are:\\n- 13: And then we're going to allow the milk to acidify or ripen for 40 minutes.\\n- 43: There's only so much ricotta you can eat.\\n\\nThe first caption (13) describes the milk being allowed to ripen for 40 minutes at a target temperature of 31 degrees celsius or 88 fahrenheit. This is the most direct answer to the question.\\n\\nThe second caption (43) mentions that the maker has already made ricotta from the whey and drained it off. This does not directly answer the question, but it does provide context that the maker has already processed the milk and removed the whey, which implies that the milk has been allowed to ripen and the heat has been turned off.\\n\\nTherefore, the two most useful captions are 13 and 43.\\n\\nOutput: 13, 43</s>\"},\n",

hair.\\n3: um, either with, like, high buns or even with there\\'s half-up, half-down, whatever.\\n4: so the bows are definitely in.\\n5: so I\\'ve made a couple here and just out of felt.\\n6: so it\\'s a really easy way, inexpensive way, to make these cute little bows.\\n7: so if you would like to know how to make em, then just keep watching.\\n8: so here\\'s what you\\'re going to need: some felt in any color that you like, and these are just colors that I picked because I\\'m making these as kind of gifts for some of my students, so that\\'s why I chose these colors, but you can choose whichever color you like.\\n9: um, also, I got these little Clips.\\n10: the filth is from the dollar store.\\n11: I didn\\'t say that, but then the clips are also from the dollar store.\\n12: I couldn\\'t find normal Clips, so I just got these like little kids clips on the set- just the dollar star as well- and I\\'ll just glue them onto the top of here.\\n13: you\\'re going to need the template for your bow ties.\\n14: now, this I got from the web.\\n15: I\\'ll just post the link to the PDF file down below so you can check that out.\\n16: print that off is cute because you\\'ve got the colors here, but you can either make them as paper if you wish, or you can make them with the felt, and then you\\'re going to need a glue gun.\\n17: now be very careful, because it is quite hot.\\n18: so just make sure you use it carefully, make sure you\\'ve got extra glue and then just like a little scrap piece of paper to put your boo stick on and then some pens.\\n19: so obviously we will start with cutting out this baby.\\n20: now.\\n21: I\\'ve already done that here.\\n22: so you\\'ve got your templates here.\\n23: so you\\'re just going to take whichever color you like.\\n24: I\\'m going to go with yellow just because it\\'s easy to see the pen marks.\\n25: now, I always like to go right up to the edge so that I don\\'t waste any fabric.\\n26: so you\\'re going to hold that nice and still, and you\\'re just going to trace it out with a pen.\\n27: so now that that is all drawn out, you\\'re just going to go ahead and use your handy dandy scissors to cut it out.\\n28: now\\'s the fun part: you get to put it all together.\\n29: so I\\'ve got my glue gun here with the pen the facing up.\\n30: you\\'re going to kind of match these and fold those babies over as you can see the bow.\\n31: so you\\'re going to do a little dot of glue- now you got to work fast so this doesn\\'t dry- and used to just do a little dot of glue right here in the center.\\n32: you\\'re going to fold this guy over and then just hold that very carefully.\\n33: you don\\'t want to burn yourself, so just be really careful here.\\n34: excellent.\\n35: and then you\\'re just going to do the exact same thing.\\n36: so you\\'re going to do a little dot of glue, don\\'t go too crazy.\\n37: and then you\\'re just going to fold this last side over that and then hold that in place.\\n38: just again, be careful, because it can be very hot, okay.\\n39: so now this is where this guy comes in, so you\\'re going to make sure.\\n40: so you want to hide these ends, because this is the top of your bow and you want to hide that.\\n41: so you\\'re going to place the smooth side over it.\\n42: you\\'re going to flip it to the back.\\n43: you\\'re going to add a little bit of glue, just a tiny bit, here.\\n44: you\\'re going to fold this guy over, hold it there in place and then do the same thoughts, same thing, wrapping the other side over, and there you have your cute little bow.\\n45: okay, so we are going to be making it into a clip.\\n46: so you\\'re going to take- I\\'m going to take the yellow one, obviously, because it matches, and then I\\'m going to put that on here.\\n47: so I\\'m going to spread glue just along here- be very careful in this part, because it\\'s quite thin- and then you\\'re just going to place your bow right on top.\\n48: now, all these little hairs that the glue gun has, don\\'t worry about those.\\n49: you could just always kind of poke them off or pick them off, okay, so make sure the glue is dry and there you have your cute little bow.\\n50: you can use this in your hair or, if you wanted to even use a safety pin, you can go ahead and do that and just put it to your clothes, your purse or whatever, but there is your yellow bow.\\n51: today I

\\xa0i still couldn't get it off and now the spray arm assembly is very loose and i doubt it will work properly. \\xa0note: i initially turned the screw the wrong way thinking it was screwed in on top of the arm, rather than the arm screwed onto it. \\xa0what do i do?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: snowy January day, too cold to be outside playing and shoveling?\\n1: don't want to shovel.\\n2: why not use the day to fix your dishwasher?\\n3: here we have a KitchenAid dishwasher that is not getting the dishes clean, which is a common complaint.\\n4: when I looked it up, I watched a 15 minute video on how to fix it.\\n5: well, you can do it in less than 15.\\n6: you certainly don't need all the details.\\n7: so here's my version: very cut down, and so just to remove these end clips so we can get this wrap.\\n8: the racks are out.\\n9: look at that.\\n10: they roll.\\n11: and that fun you could put your little kid in there.\\n12: okay, I've been at this less than one minute.\\n13: now we just remove this piece from the clips.\\n14: it sounds like I'm breaking.\\n15: that makes it sound like it's more fun.\\n16: that's not so hard.\\n17: next we're gonna undo this.\\n18: by the way, one thing we've learned: never move the assembly in its housing in the cabinet, because what will happen is the water line that's behind your brakes.\\n19: yeah, that leaks into the ceiling and goes to the next level underneath you.\\n20: you know my case: it was pouring out of the ceiling into my printer.\\n21: that was all fun.\\n22: alright, might be good to clean up the blood off your hand for those of you who are health minded.\\n23: so we're not putting biomaterials bounding your dishwasher- not that there isn't already some other nasty biomaterials.\\n24: Oh, a bread clip- yes, we would like to wash that off our plates.\\n25: good thing we didn't rinse, because then Tom wouldn't have something to do during the day on a Sunday afternoon.\\n26: so you reach down in there cautious to get all the infection you can in your open cut.\\n27: in the next segment we'll be teaching stitching- home stitching of open wounds of the hand.\\n28: alright, so you get all this stuff out of here, and I guess there's a little something-something down here- I don't know what the technical term is- that you want to really get cleared up.\\n29: that's the important part.\\n30: and I guess we want to take this one screw out of here.\\n31: see there, this is a cover for the part that shreds your food.\\n32: it's like a garbage disposal piece.\\n33: take this cover off, okay.\\n34: next there's a simple little plastic thing that you can unscrew, so it seems.\\n35: so you sit there in a wedge on and it won't come loose.\\n36: so you're thinking I'm stuck, I can't do this two minutes into the project and I'm doses, so you grab up big pliers like this just makes you look like you're working harder.\\n37: so if you're doing a honey-do list, should be even that more proud of you.\\n38: anyway, you don't really need one that big.\\n39: but let's see, I don't have a tripod.\\n40: hold it with my chin simply because your hand has more leverage.\\n41: just hold it there and reverse this backwards.\\n42: it's like a lever.\\n43: you know not, you're gonna leave her because she gave you a list, but because you're, it's a lever and you get leverage, then you can just unscrew the whole thing and kind of have fun with it, wiggle it out how it comes to minutes into the project.\\n44: you can put that on with rolling Curt, ride every little kid.\\n45: hold this in front of them, say it's a propeller.\\n46: I'll show you that one in the second part of this clip accent.\\n47: oh no, I need another tool.\\n48: I need something.\\n49: unscrew these and it's called the torque screwdriver, they said on the website, which made it something complicated and like something I could no longer figure out.\\n50: and to get to this fourth screw underneath this, they said: just simply lift this and twist it a few degrees.\\n51: look at this, I look important.\\n52: I'm taking apart an entire your dishwasher.\\n53: I should be making what a repairman makes, right?\\n54: no, but I'll be making more points because I got a bigger tool.\\n55: didn't mean anything, but it, by the way, okay, breathless, star-shaped.\\n56: I don't know what that's called screws.\\n57: they can't just be normal screws, of course not.\\n58: then you couldn't use something fun like this and you get an attachment, basically these- the size is like my glasses anyway.\\n59: yeah, it's a hook it up to your D Walt, there look important, and I was miss aiming the fixing dude dishwasher and the fourth one in spec we hang here.\\n60: so what's basically their dishwashers?\\n61: not getting our plates and glasses clean?\\n62: so it's leaving a residue of a key food.\\n63: there's probably shrimp tails down in here.\\n64: does it get down through here?\\n65: I know we don't have toothpicks, bro.\\n66: see, y'all know what that goes to now.\\n67: you'll figure it out later.\\n68: um, just take these up.\\n69: you don't want to drop them down on there, but even if you do, they'll be where the shrimp tails are.\\n70: shrimp tails for dishwashers.\\n71: alright, once those they're out, basically grab this assembly.\\n72: two hands is better, but I am holding a video camera and you basically just grabbed it out of.\\n73: keep it all together, set that off to the side.\\n74: leaving a little bit makes you look really important and your honey really appreciate.\\n75: of course you might appreciate it.\\n76: - Kevin, cleanfoodies, a good thing.\\n77: yeah, there's a gnarly thing in there.\\n78: with some more knowledge, court might be good to rinse your pleats before you do the dishes, just sayin: all right, that's an interesting problem.\\n79: it's a long ways down into there and even though I own a Dewalt, it won't reach without touching the side.\\n80: so if you're lucky, like I was, we went to a garage sale where they were basically selling.\\n81: I don't know if she was divorced or what, but a guy was selling all the tools.\\n82: I assume maybe a divorce, or maybe she's just mad, or maybe she stole, I don't know.\\n83: I didn't care because I got this- y'all hear this ugly companion, for she had five bucks on it.\\n84: I talked to down to two bucks.\\n85: it was all certain tool stuff, broken dishwasher and so long story short, and I found this little guy.\\n86: this is an extender, so I put the star bit in there.\\n87: look at that, it'll fit.\\n88: so just add that to the DeWalt.\\n89: and no, and I'm not paid by the wok you got for advertising this material.\\n90: maybe they will send me a free tool.\\n91: I'm some sort.\\n92: I don't need any of this.\\n93: I got for 2 bucks.\\n94: of course they fooled me.\\n95: that was a different size, so we gotta go to that 215 or something.\\n96: military.\\n97: ok, this cover for the food shredder or whatever they call it.\\n98: I- I really use technical terms, as you can tell- basically just lifts to the right if you're facing into the discharge, if you're facing out of the dishwasher and you shouldn't be in there- you get up before you bring something.\\n99: and this is why the dishwasher, of course those dealing with teenagers.\\n100: you have three, like we know.\\n101: you got three cache washers and of course the fourth because I would do dishes any time necessary.\\n102: this is when you get to view a couple years worth of things that you wash, like a character piece of corn and a couple of rocks, lots of dog hair.\\n103: these are plastic.\\n104: look at that thing, Milt.\\n105: I knew I smelled that one day.\\n106: so you get this thing all cleaned up.\\n107: I know this is the gross part of the show, but just think how clean it's gonna be.\\n108: that looks like brand-new high.\\n109: your most important tool: the spoon.\\n110: you can spoon out the lobster tails and cracker crumbs- and yeah, that's definitely a lot.\\n111: not lobster tail, I meant shrimp tail.\\n112: I don't eat lobster- one bite.\\n113: if I come and fix your dishwasher.\\n114: you come buy me a lobster dinner, all right.\\n115: well, that's pretty well wrapping up, and I'm only five minutes into this job.\\n116: so, mmm, tasty tastes like they're.\\n117: after cleaning this out, you find that you had uncooked pasta, shells and seeds and pieces of plastic and rocks and dog hair and bones and all sorts of- Oh, a pumpkin seed.\\n118: that ought to be good.\\n119: um, so it didn't.\\n120: you know, the longest part of this project was for me to just get in as my hand hanging over that stuff over there.\\n121: there's one more step.\\n122: there's, um, a rubber seal thing that is a flapper valve.\\n123: you got to reach down and get that out.\\n124: little flapper belt is located great down there.\\n125: see that black part.\\n126: Oh, just reach in there as your fingers use your fingernails, grab ahold of it, pull it out.\\n127: it's just a flapper belt.\\n128: it opens and closes and basically I didn't find anything in there.\\n129: but you didn't want to pull that out and check it in case it's not opening and closing correctly.\\n130: to let here just wash a green.\\n131: that was clean, which is amazing.\\n132: maybe I'll only show that.\\n133: pretty okay, the worst was over.\\n134: no, it's the reassembly part.\\n135: the flapper screen is in there.\\n136: figuring out which way these things go okay is gonna be the part that's most important in this.\\n137: you get everything put back like it should and that piece goes in there.\\n138: we'll put the this filter on notice.\\n139: that filter does not filter out.\\n140: much surprised about that, but you know, stuff gets passed here and it's supposed to get groaned up but you can't grow it up.\\n141: pumpkin, see.\\n142: and then I'll click.\\n143: I know what I'm doing.\\n144: got a dremel tool down in the deep part of the dishwasher.\\n145: yeah, it's making those tool like noises and when you put it back together you know work.\\n146: you're gonna be looking charming when you have this all assembled, that back together.\\n147: okay, if it's right in there like that, this gets a quarter turn to get it started in to be seated and then next we get that lope.\\n148: nope, not the propeller, this part.\\n149: but before you get too carried away and put this in place, remember to put the one screw that is going to be obstructed back in place.\\n150: now, if you have this assembling the right spot, it'll seat up.\\n151: I recommend a couple hand twist to make sure it started and then reel it in there.\\n152: remember to switch back to your key 20 bet.\\n153: geez, I don't know what I'm doing with my extender on there, just wake up, look like something's over.\\n154: okay, taking things apart there's a lot easier than putting them back together.\\n155: I recommend just taking this clip off.\\n156: leave this piece by itself.\\n157: so that reassembly.\\n158: I'm showing you how to do it the hard way.\\n159: so do this whole bit.\\n160: there it is now it's in place.\\n161: so now you have this back together here, clip it back in the place back here, clip it into place up above.\\n162: those clips are super simple.\\n163: next we shall install the propeller.\\n164: this is what makes your dishwasher phone hold on.\\n165: no, we don't.\\n166: I'm showing you how to do it wrong.\\n167: yeah, remember these guys.\\n168: yeah, three of them.\\n169: so, and I can put the other one in in that food shredder earlier.\\n170: just get these lined up first, all three of them.\\n171: don't drop them down inside here you'll be disassembling again.\\n172: no, Stephanie, no, disassemble, disassemble.\\n173: you gotta be my age to know.\\n174: can you name that movie?\\n175: write it in the comments first.\\n176: one, to get it right, gets free dishwasher repair video.\\n177: alright.\\n178: so next comes this assembly.\\n179: that's a lot of shrimp moves through it.\\n180: the jets looks more like a propeller to me.\\n181: um, you may have to kind of monkey with a little bit, back it up a little bit to give it a seat, then you can start screwing it in.\\n182: alright, this little guy is tricky.\\n183: you gotta hold this down right here and what's?\\n184: your other hand, hold this in place and then, um, you know, hold this in place.\\n185: yeah, there we go, and then push this clockwise, just spin it tight, then the whole thing comes down.\\n186: they're just a matter of ten minutes.\\n187: you got all the pumpkin seeds and fish tails and everything else out of your dishwasher and put those racks back in and then give anyone a ride on those scraps.\\n188: so you lower the wheels down into the carriage and then that's in place.\\n189: you just simply snap those back in, put your axe back in the bottom rack, just goes in on wheels.\\n190: no assembly required for that part of it.\\n191: cheer parts all fit.\\n192: the door is sealing.\\n193: give it a

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhope you are still monitoring comments. \\xa0you've got over 200,000 views on this! \\xa0good job. \\xa0i ran into a problem: \\xa0i can't get the bottom spray arm off, no matter how hard i try. \\xa0i even tried to muscle it out over the screw figuring i'd replace damaged parts. \\xa0i still couldn't get it off and now the spray arm assembly is very loose and i doubt it will work properly. \\xa0note: i initially turned the screw the wrong way thinking it was screwed in on top of the arm, rather than the arm screwed onto it. \\xa0what do i do?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: snowy January day, too cold to be outside playing and shoveling?\\n1: don't want to shovel.\\n2: why not use the day to fix your dishwasher?\\n3: here we have a KitchenAid dishwasher that is not getting the dishes clean, which is a common complaint.\\n4: when I looked it up, I watched a 15 minute video on how to fix it.\\n5: well, you can do it in less than 15.\\n6: you certainly don't need all the details.\\n7: so here's my version: very cut down, and so just to remove these end clips so we can get this wrap.\\n8: the racks are out.\\n9: look at that.\\n10: they roll.\\n11: and that fun you could put your little kid in there.\\n12: okay, I've been at this less than one minute.\\n13: now we just remove this piece from the clips.\\n14: it sounds like I'm breaking.\\n15: that makes it sound like it's more fun.\\n16: that's not so hard.\\n17: next we're gonna undo this.\\n18: by the way, one thing we've learned: never move the assembly in its housing in the cabinet, because what will happen is the water line that's behind your brakes.\\n19: yeah, that leaks into the ceiling and goes to the next level underneath you.\\n20: you know my case: it was pouring out of the ceiling into my printer.\\n21: that was all fun.\\n22: alright, might be good to clean up the blood off your hand for those of you who are health minded.\\n23: so we're not putting biomaterials bounding your dishwasher- not that there isn't already some other nasty biomaterials.\\n24: Oh, a bread clip- yes, we would like to wash that off our plates.\\n25: good thing we didn't rinse, because then Tom wouldn't have something to do during the day on a Sunday afternoon.\\n26: so you reach down in there cautious to get all the infection you can in your open cut.\\n27: in the next segment we'll be teaching stitching- home stitching of open wounds of the hand.\\n28: alright, so you get all this stuff out of here, and I guess there's a little something-something down here- I don't know what the technical term is- that you want to really get cleared up.\\n29: that's the important part.\\n30: and I guess we want to take this one screw out of here.\\n31: see there, this is a cover for the part that shreds your food.\\n32: it's like a garbage disposal piece.\\n33: take this cover off, okay.\\n34: next there's a simple little plastic thing that you can unscrew, so it seems.\\n35: so you sit there in a wedge on and it won't come loose.\\n36: so you're thinking I'm stuck, I can't do this two minutes into the project and I'm doses, so you grab up big pliers like this just makes you look like you're working harder.\\n37: so if you're doing a honey-do list, should be even that more proud of you.\\n38: anyway, you don't really need one that big.\\n39: but let's see, I don't have a tripod.\\n40: hold it with my chin simply because your hand has more leverage.\\n41: just hold it there and reverse this backwards.\\n42: it's like a lever.\\n43: you know not, you're gonna leave her because she gave you a list, but because you're, it's a lever and you get leverage, then you can just unscrew the whole thing and kind of have fun with it, wiggle it out how it comes to minutes into the project.\\n44: you can put that on with rolling Curt, ride every little kid.\\n45: hold this in front of them, say it's a propeller.\\n46: I'll show you that one in the second part of this clip accent.\\n47: oh no, I need another tool.\\n48: I need something.\\n49: unscrew these and it's called the torque screwdriver, they said on the website, which made it something complicated and like something I could no longer figure out.\\n50: and to get to this fourth screw underneath this, they said: just simply lift this and twist it a few degrees.\\n51: look at this, I look important.\\n52: I'm taking apart an entire your dishwasher.\\n53: I should be making what a repairman makes, right?\\n54: no, but I'll be making more points because I got a bigger tool.\\n55: didn't mean anything, but it, by the way, okay, breathless, star-shaped.\\n56: I don't know what that's called screws.\\n57: they can't just be normal screws, of course not.\\n58: then you couldn't use something fun like this and you get an attachment, basically these- the size is like my glasses anyway.\\n59: yeah, it's a hook it up to your D Walt, there look important, and I was miss aiming the fixing dude dishwasher and the fourth one in spec we hang here.\\n60: so what's basically their dishwashers?\\n61: not getting our plates and glasses clean?\\n62: so it's leaving a residue of a key food.\\n63: there's probably shrimp tails down in here.\\n64: does it get down through here?\\n65: I know we don't have toothpicks, bro.\\n66: see, y'all know what that goes to now.\\n67: you'll figure it out later.\\n68: um, just take these up.\\n69: you don't want to drop them down on there, but even if you do, they'll be where the shrimp tails are.\\n70: shrimp tails for dishwashers.\\n71: alright, once those they're out, basically grab this assembly.\\n72: two hands is better, but I am holding a video camera and you basically just grabbed it out of.\\n73: keep it all together, set that off to the side.\\n74: leaving a little bit makes you look really important and your honey really appreciate.\\n75: of course you might appreciate it.\\n76: - Kevin, cleanfoodies, a good thing.\\n77: yeah, there's a gnarly thing in there.\\n78: with some more knowledge, court might be good to rinse your pleats before you do the dishes, just sayin: all right, that's an interesting problem.\\n79: it's a long ways down into there and even though I own a Dewalt, it won't reach without touching the side.\\n80: so if you're lucky, like I was, we went to a garage sale where they were basically selling.\\n81: I don't know if she was divorced or what, but a guy was selling all the tools.\\n82: I assume maybe a divorce, or maybe she's just mad, or maybe she stole, I don't know.\\n83: I didn't care because I got this- y'all hear this ugly companion, for she had five bucks on it.\\n84: I talked to down to two bucks.\\n85: it was all certain tool stuff, broken dishwasher and so long story short, and I found this little guy.\\n86: this is an extender, so I put the star bit in there.\\n87: look at that, it'll fit.\\n88: so just add that to the DeWalt.\\n89: and no, and I'm not paid by the wok you got for advertising this material.\\n90: maybe they will send me a free tool.\\n91: I'm some sort.\\n92: I don't need any of this.\\n93: I got for 2 bucks.\\n94: of course they fooled me.\\n95: that was a different size, so we gotta go to that 215 or something.\\n96: military.\\n97: ok, this cover for the food shredder or whatever they call it.\\n98: I- I really use technical terms, as you can tell- basically just lifts to the right if you're facing into the discharge, if you're facing out of the dishwasher and you shouldn't be in there- you get up before you bring something.\\n99: and this is why the dishwasher, of course those dealing with teenagers.\\n100: you have three, like we know.\\n101: you got three cache washers and of course the fourth because I would do dishes any time necessary.\\n102: this is when you get to view a couple years worth of things that you wash, like a character piece of corn and a couple of rocks, lots of dog hair.\\n103: these are plastic.\\n104: look at that thing, Milt.\\n105: I knew I smelled that one day.\\n106: so you get this thing all cleaned up.\\n107: I know this is the gross part of the show, but just think how clean it's gonna be.\\n108: that looks like brand-new high.\\n109: your most important tool: the spoon.\\n110: you can spoon out the lobster tails and cracker crumbs- and yeah, that's definitely a lot.\\n111: not lobster tail, I meant shrimp tail.\\n112: I don't eat lobster- one bite.\\n113: if I come and fix your dishwasher.\\n114: you come buy me a lobster dinner, all right.\\n115: well, that's pretty well wrapping up, and I'm only five minutes into this job.\\n116: so, mmm, tasty tastes like they're.\\n117: after cleaning this out, you find that you had uncooked pasta, shells and seeds and pieces of plastic and rocks and dog hair and bones and all sorts of- Oh, a pumpkin seed.\\n118: that ought to be good.\\n119: um, so it didn't.\\n120: you know, the longest part of this project was for me to just get in as my hand hanging over that stuff over there.\\n121: there's one more step.\\n122: there's, um, a rubber seal thing that is a flapper valve.\\n123: you got to reach down and get that out.\\n124: little flapper belt is located great down there.\\n125: see that black part.\\n126: Oh, just reach in there as your fingers use your fingernails, grab ahold of it, pull it out.\\n127: it's just a flapper belt.\\n128: it opens and closes and basically I didn't find anything in there.\\n129: but you didn't want to pull that out and check it in case it's not opening and closing correctly.\\n130: to let here just wash a green.\\n131: that was clean, which is amazing.\\n132: maybe I'll only show that.\\n133: pretty okay, the worst was over.\\n134: no, it's the reassembly part.\\n135: the flapper screen is in there.\\n136: figuring out which way these things go okay is gonna be the part that's most important in this.\\n137: you get everything put back like it should and that piece goes in there.\\n138: we'll put the this filter on notice.\\n139: that filter does not filter out.\\n140: much surprised about that, but you know, stuff gets passed here and it's supposed to get groaned up but you can't grow it up.\\n141: pumpkin, see.\\n142: and then I'll click.\\n143: I know what I'm doing.\\n144: got a dremel tool down in the deep part of the dishwasher.\\n145: yeah, it's making those tool like noises and when you put it back together you know work.\\n146: you're gonna be looking charming when you have this all assembled, that back together.\\n147: okay, if it's right in there like that, this gets a quarter turn to get it started in to be seated and then next we get that lope.\\n148: nope, not the propeller, this part.\\n149: but before you get too carried away and put this in place, remember to put the one screw that is going to be obstructed back in place.\\n150: now, if you have this assembling the right spot, it'll seat up.\\n151: I recommend a couple hand twist to make sure it started and then reel it in there.\\n152: remember to switch back to your key 20 bet.\\n153: geez, I don't know what I'm doing with my extender on there, just wake up, look like something's over.\\n154: okay, taking things apart there's a lot easier than putting them back together.\\n155: I recommend just taking this clip off.\\n156: leave this piece by itself.\\n157: so that reassembly.\\n158: I'm showing you how to do it the hard way.\\n159: so do this whole bit.\\n160: there it is now it's in place.\\n161: so now you have this back together here, clip it back in the place back here, clip it into place up above.\\n162: those clips are super simple.\\n163: next we shall install the propeller.\\n164: this is what makes your dishwasher phone hold on.\\n165: no, we don't.\\n166: I'm showing you how to do it wrong.\\n167: yeah, remember these

channel.\\n5: hello everyone.\\n6: it's me Christine, again the nail girl.\\n7: some time ago, I did a makeup tutorial and you guys liked it, which was weird because the whole thing was meant to be a joke.\\n8: due to popular demand, I've decided to bring back simply face- logical, because I got it face.\\n9: might as well use it.\\n10: you know, if they say, if you've got a face, flaunt it.\\n11: that what they say, that's not what they say.\\n12: if you're new here and you like stupid, you should subscribe because I got a lot of that.\\n13: ok, let's begin.\\n14: this is my face without makeup.\\n15: after my last makeup tutorial, I would left wondering: is there such a thing as hollow makeup?\\n16: and guess what I found civil?\\n17: oh, my god.\\n18: ok, this lighting is terrible.\\n19: you can't see.\\n20: it's like blue and then it's like pink, and I also got this one.\\n21: it's like a pinkish version.\\n22: first.\\n23: I think I should probably do the rest of my face and do the lips last, to make it like perfect, and then take pictures, and that's like the order of beauty.\\n24: people do this in write my name is simply face logical.\\n25: don't put me.\\n26: why is there like glitter on my forehead?\\n27: where did that even come?\\n28: there's no way glitter can look bad.\\n29: so, or I do my face, though I think I should use some of this exfoliating stuff, this stuff, to exfoliate my huge lips.\\n30: yeah, how do people like not eat this?\\n31: all right, so since I've already given you guys a makeup tutorial and you should know exactly how to do your face, this simply face logical way, I'm just gonna speed through my face part so we can get right on to the lips.\\n32: alright, so next is supposed to be foundation, but I don't like wearing that, so I'm just not gonna do it.\\n33: powders all over my shirt, man, now is when I suppose I should put some on my eyes.\\n34: but let's talk.\\n35: and more makeup.\\n36: right, you're here to learn hair.\\n37: literally don't know how to blend any better than this.\\n38: Nicki would be so disappointed in me.\\n39: it's a good thing this isn't an eye makeup tutorial.\\n40: every in here is one blue and ones like green with the same eyeshadow, 7 hours, thank, we're just gonna put the makeup back under here.\\n41: how did this happen to me?\\n42: shits on the camera.\\n43: Oh, while I'm doing this, I should tell you about my second channel.\\n44: don't have any expectations.\\n45: I started it for a random.\\n46: that doesn't really make sense to put on this channel things that don't have to do with males, come to think of it.\\n47: why am I putting this video on my main channel anyways?\\n48: it's basically for anything I do and record.\\n49: that is simply not logical.\\n50: but, um, it'll be like Dan and Phil's arts-and-crafts channel where they upload like once a year.\\n51: subscribe to it, please don't forget this.\\n52: alright, let's put some eyelashes on, cuz I don't have any on my face already.\\n53: which eyeball is this?\\n54: okay, this is the right.\\n55: nothing.\\n56: I don't know how anyone wears these.\\n57: they are so massive.\\n58: this is the only eye I can see out of all.\\n59: right, now that my eyes are beautiful and complete, it's time for what you all came here for- the hollow lip tutorial, yes, so let me explain my thinking to you first, in case it doesn't work out.\\n60: then you will know what I wanted to do.\\n61: so you know how, in nail polish hland, we might do like a black creme polish and then a hollow topcoat on top of that, and then it really makes the Hollow pop, versus if you just put hollow over top of your bare nail or like a light nudie color.\\n62: it wouldn't really show up that much.\\n63: so I thought, what if I did like basically black lips and then put the hollow on top of that?\\n64: I just realized I don't have lip liner.\\n65: that's black or dark, but that's what eyeliner is for.\\n66: alright, yeah, scary, eyeliner and lip liner are the same thing.\\n67: right, you just use different names for marketing.\\n68: it's really hard when you don't have much to trace.\\n69: now I'm just gonna go in with some dark purple.\\n70: this is a nail channel.\\n71: I don't know anything.\\n72: I know nothing.\\n73: okay, that is like totally not right and I'm gonna blame it on looking at the mirror like sideways.\\n74: so let me just do that properly.\\n75: alright, so I might have over drawn my lips just just a bit.\\n76: I blame social media for that.\\n77: one hello.\\n78: I'm a clown, a dead one.\\n79: now that that's done, let's put some holo on this and see if I was right.\\n80: all right, here.\\n81: here goes.\\n82: that's kind of cool.\\n83: how friggin cool would it be if a clip artist with the lip drips, the lip porn, Vlad, Vlad, mwah, Vlad, mwah- if she did holographic lips with the drip at the bottom sows, he's sick.\\n84: look at me go.\\n85: it's my makeup tree whoa that turned like yellow.\\n86: that is so cool.\\n87: it's like an oil spill.\\n88: Oh guys, oh no, I can't touch my list together.\\n89: ah, how do they do it?\\n90: God took a picture- he got a bigger picture, clerk, but I think this is so cool.\\n91: oh my god, I should do a hundred layers of this.\\n92: not, I didn't mean for it to go that far.\\n93: it looks like I ate a radioactive mermaid.\\n94: so, in summary, I think this looks pretty cool.\\n95: look it with all the light shifting.\\n96: I'm so scared.\\n97: I'm so scared there's still powder up.\\n98: I know.\\n99: no, it's gonna say, is this lip look shifts in the lake.\\n100: you look there, it's like more indigo.\\n101: there it's more green.\\n102: okay, I'm calling on you members of the beauty community who can actually do things properly on their face, someone else, do this.\\n103: make it look good, please, so I can totally see this look working for like an everyday office look.\\n104: in fact, I think I'm gonna wear this to work tomorrow.\\n105: oh, it's good thing.\\n106: my boss is very open.\\n107: so I thought this was gonna be a hollow lip, but it ended up looking more like an oil spill mermaid look, which I think it's equally cool.\\n108: I'm accepting of all magical, majestic creatures on my face.\\n109: so subscribe to my channel.\\n110: see of her great makeup to talk.\\n111: also, subscribe to my second channel.\\n112: I don't know what's gonna go on it yet, but you should subscribe anyways.\\n113: it's not like you haven't signed up for anything.\\n114: you didn't know what it

card.\\n119: you get a special privilege.\\n120: now you have to see the peel porn.\\n121: except there's no peeling.\\n122: and this is there.\\n123: dammit, I really wish this peeled because it

terrible.\\n19: you can't see.\\n20: it's like blue and then it's like pink, and I also got this one.\\n21: it's like a pinkish version.\\n22: first.\\n23: I think I should probably do the rest of my face and do the lips last, to make it like perfect, and then take pictures, and that's like the order of beauty.\\n24: people do this in write my name is simply face logical.\\n25: don't put me.\\n26: why is there like glitter on my forehead?\\n27: where did that even come?\\n28: there's no way glitter can look bad.\\n29: so, or I do my face, though I think I should use some of this exfoliating stuff, this stuff, to exfoliate my huge lips.\\n30: yeah, how do people like not eat this?\\n31: all right, so since I've already given you guys a makeup tutorial and you should know exactly how to do your face, this simply face logical way, I'm just gonna speed through my face part so we can get right on to the lips.\\n32: alright, so next is supposed to be foundation, but I don't like wearing that, so I'm just not gonna do it.\\n33: powders all over my shirt, man, now is when I suppose I should put some on my eyes.\\n34: but let's talk.\\n35: and more makeup.\\n36: right, you're here to learn hair.\\n37: literally don't know how to blend any better than this.\\n38: Nicki would be so disappointed in me.\\n39: it's a good thing this isn't an eye makeup tutorial.\\n40: every in here is one blue and ones like green with the same eyeshadow, 7 hours, thank, we're just gonna put the makeup back under here.\\n41: how did this happen to me?\\n42: shits on the camera.\\n43: Oh, while I'm doing this, I should tell you about my second channel.\\n44: don't have any expectations.\\n45: I started it for a random.\\n46: that doesn't really make sense to put on this channel things that don't have to do with males, come to think of it.\\n47: why am I putting this video on my main channel anyways?\\n48: it's basically for anything I do and record.\\n49: that is simply not logical.\\n50: but, um, it'll be like Dan and Phil's arts-and-crafts channel where they upload like once a year.\\n51: subscribe to it, please don't forget this.\\n52: alright, let's put some eyelashes on, cuz I don't have any on my face already.\\n53: which eyeball is this?\\n54: okay, this is the right.\\n55: nothing.\\n56: I don't know how anyone wears these.\\n57: they are so massive.\\n58: this is the only eye I can see out of all.\\n59: right, now that my eyes are beautiful and complete, it's time for what you all came here for- the hollow lip tutorial, yes, so let me explain my thinking to you first, in case it doesn't work out.\\n60: then you will know what I wanted to do.\\n61: so you know how, in nail polish hland, we might do like a black creme polish and then a hollow topcoat on top of that, and then it really makes the Hollow pop, versus if you just put hollow over top of your bare nail or like a light nudie color.\\n62: it wouldn't really show up that much.\\n63: so I thought, what if I did like basically black lips and then put the hollow on top of that?\\n64: I just realized I don't have lip liner.\\n65: that's black or dark, but that's what eyeliner is for.\\n66: alright, yeah, scary, eyeliner and lip liner are the same thing.\\n67: right, you just use different names for marketing.\\n68: it's really hard when you don't have much to trace.\\n69: now I'm just gonna go in with some dark purple.\\n70: this is a nail channel.\\n71: I don't know anything.\\n72: I know nothing.\\n73: okay, that is like totally not right and I'm gonna blame it on looking at the mirror like sideways.\\n74: so let me just do that properly.\\n75: alright, so I might have over drawn my lips just just a bit.\\n76: I blame social media for that.\\n77: one hello.\\n78: I'm a clown, a dead one.\\n79: now that that's done, let's put some holo on this and see if I was right.\\n80: all right, here.\\n81: here goes.\\n82: that's kind of cool.\\n83: how friggin cool would it be if a clip artist with the lip drips, the lip porn, Vlad, Vlad, mwah, Vlad, mwah- if she did holographic lips with the drip at the bottom sows, he's sick.\\n84: look at me go.\\n85: it's my makeup tree whoa that turned like yellow.\\n86: that is so cool.\\n87: it's like an oil spill.\\n88: Oh guys, oh no, I can't touch my list together.\\n89: ah, how do they do it?\\n90: God took a picture- he got a bigger picture, clerk, but I think this is so cool.\\n91: oh my god, I should do a hundred layers of this.\\n92: not, I didn't mean for it to go that far.\\n93: it looks like I ate a radioactive mermaid.\\n94: so, in summary, I think this looks pretty cool.\\n95: look it with all the light shifting.\\n96: I'm so scared.\\n97: I'm so scared there's still powder up.\\n98: I know.\\n99: no, it's gonna say, is this lip look shifts in the lake.\\n100: you look there, it's like more indigo.\\n101: there it's more green.\\n102: okay, I'm calling on you members of the beauty community who can actually do things properly on their face, someone else, do this.\\n103: make it look good, please, so I can totally see this look working for like an everyday office look.\\n104: in fact, I think I'm gonna wear this to work tomorrow.\\n105: oh, it's good thing.\\n106: my boss is very open.\\n107: so I thought this was gonna be a hollow lip, but it ended up looking more like an oil spill mermaid look, which I think it's equally cool.\\n108: I'm accepting of all magical, majestic creatures on my face.\\n109: so subscribe to my channel.\\n110: see of her great makeup to talk.\\n111: also, subscribe to my second channel.\\n112: I don't know what's gonna go on it yet, but you should subscribe anyways.\\n113: it's not like you haven't signed up for anything.\\n114: you didn't know what it was.\\n115: this is such a runway.\\n116: look, I can see it now, Marc Jacobs.\\n117: alright, guys, thanks so much for watching and I'll see y'all.\\n118: ah, good for you for staying past the end card.\\n119: you get a special privilege.\\n120: now you have to see the peel porn.\\n121: except there's no peeling.\\n122: and this is there.\\n123: dammit, I really wish this peeled because it would be an epic contribution to my fili bag.\\n124: Kyle, here goes nothing.\\n125: that's how much I overdo my lips.\\n126: I'm happy with my non-existent lips.\\n127: there's all these tutorials on how to make your lips bigger and make your eyes bigger.\\n128: where's the tutorials on just put makeup on your face, whatever shape your face is?\\n129: when I was a kid, I used to do this.\\n130:

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nhi pailin. new to your channel 😉 love the bread recipe. can you stuff it?\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: (lively music) - Hey everyone.\\n1: Welcome to Pai\\'s Kitchen.\\n2: I am making my very first bread recipe of the show, but not any kind of bread.\\n3: I am making Asian-style fluffy, light as cloud bread.\\n4: Now in Asia, they like to call this Hokkaido milk bun, not because I\\'m using milk from Hokkaido or anything.\\n5: That\\'s just the name that they use.\\n6: There is a lot of milk in the recipe, which is one of the secret to its fluffiness.\\n7: Now if you have been intimidated by bread baking, I get you, I\\'ve been there, but trust me.\\n8: This recipe is very forgiving.\\n9: Give it a go.\\n10: I think you\\'re going to have success.\\n11: So, let\\'s get started.\\n12: So, the very first thing I\\'ve got to make is what\\'s called a milk roux, or tangzhong in, I believe, Chinese.\\n13: This is the secret to the fluffiness and softness of the bread.\\n14: It\\'s super, super easy.\\n15: Okay, it\\'s just two ingredient, milk and flour, so I got here some whole milk.\\n16: Wee!\\n17: And into this I\\'m gonna add some flour.\\n18: And I\\'m using bread flour because we are after all making bread.\\n19: Bread flour is high in gluten.\\n20: It\\'s gonna allow you to create that chewiness of the bread.\\n21: So I\\'m gonna give this a whisk to make sure I get rid of any flour lumps.\\n22: Now I\\'m gonna turn this on.\\n23: And once I turn the heat on, I wanna be stirring all the time.\\n24: Once the milk starts heating up, it starts getting thicker.\\n25: That\\'s exactly what you\\'re going for.\\n26: Oh, look at that, look at that.\\n27: And once it\\'s super thick like this, basically, once it\\'s not getting any thicker than where it\\'s at, turn off the heat.\\n28: So you might be thinking, \"What the heck is she doing? \"I thought we were making bread.\\n29: \"Why is she making this goo?\" So, what\\'s happening is in order to have fluffy and soft bread, you need a lot of moisture content in the bread.\\n30: But if I were to add all of that milk into my dough straight, the dough would be so wet and I couldn\\'t really handle it, right?\\n31: But by making a roux, you\\'ve turned the liquid milk into this thick paste, and so I am now able to force this much liquid into the dough, without making the dough too wet.\\n32: Brilliant, right?\\n33: And this is a secret for a lot of Asian style bread.\\n34: When I found out about it, it\\'s...\\n35: It\\'s amazing.\\n36: So that\\'s it!\\n37: So now my tangzhong is still a little bit warm.\\n38: I\\'m gonna add it to my liquid ingredients here.\\n39: So I\\'ve got some evaporated milk.\\n40: And you can use regular milk.\\n41: I just find evaporated milk is like extra milky milk.\\n42: (laughs) It\\'s richer and more delicious, but, totally, regular whole milk is fine.\\n43: No skim milk though.\\n44: No skim milk.\\n45: And this just helps it cool down, so you don\\'t have to sit there and wait for this paste to cool down.\\n46: Eggs.\\n47: Well, egg.\\n48: This is one egg.\\n49: Give that a quick stir.\\n50: Again, don\\'t worry about the tangzhong being still lumpy.\\n51: it will get all kneaded out.\\n52: Okay, so I am using my beautiful pink machine here.\\n53: You can do this all by hand.\\n54: So, in here, I\\'m going in with bread flour, and I have done this, half whole wheat, half white flour.\\n55: That worked really well as well.\\n56: So if you wanna make this a little healthier, you can.\\n57: So I like to always use instant yeast, instead of active dry yeast.\\n58: It\\'s just so much easier to work with.\\n59: You just add it to your dry ingredients, and you don\\'t have to worry about blooming it and all that stuff, and the results are the same.\\n60: So I\\'m just gonna give this a quick, just mix with my hand just to get the yeast all mixed in there a little bit.\\n61: All my liquids going in.\\n62: So all I\\'m gonna do right now is mix the dough just until the dry flour is absorbed.\\n63: We\\'re not gonna really knead it knead it.\\n64: (machine whirring) Okay, so that\\'s good enough.\\n65: So there\\'s no more dry flour in the mix, but the dough is still quite rough.\\n66: I\\'m gonna let it rest at this point for 20 minutes.\\n67: And this is a process called autolyse.\\n68: I think that\\'s how you pronounce it.\\n69: And this process allows hydration of the flour and for gluten development without kneading and therefore oxidizing the dough.\\n70: Because if you knead the dough too much, it actually negatively affects the flavor and the texture of the bread.\\n71: So this way, you won\\'t end up needing to knead the bread.\\n72: That\\'s a lot of kneed!\\n73: You won\\'t need to knead the bread for as much time.\\n74: So the bread is well-rested.\\n75: We\\'re now gonna continue the kneading process.\\n76: So I\\'ll make sure I\\'ll lock this first, and on low.\\n77: And now, I\\'m going to add my seasoning, my salt and sugar.\\n78: And I didn\\'t add the salt and sugar in the beginning, because it can interfere with the autolysis.\\n79: And the sugar, you can actually add more.\\n80: I\\'m only adding a couple tablespoons.\\n81: If you want this to be a sweeter bread, I found that three works really well.\\n82: Four will make it distinctly sweet, so it just depends on what kind of bread you\\'re going for.\\n83: So when you first add the sugar and the salt, it\\'ll kinda spin like crazy.\\n84: So I just like to stop it and scrape it off the hook.\\n85: and basically you wanna keep kneading.\\n86: Keep kneading it until it\\'s smooth, okay.\\n87: And I like to, every minute or so, take it off the hook and just re-adjust because I find you get a piece that\\'s stuck right here that\\'s not getting kneaded.\\n88: (lively music) The bread is now relatively smooth.\\n89: Mmm.\\n90: I love touching dough.\\n91: One very important ingredient that we need to add, and I\\'m just gonna take this off the hook.\\n92: I\\'m gonna add butter, and you wanna leave the butter till the end.\\n93: Because if you add it in the beginning, it\\'ll interfere with the gluten development, and your bread won\\'t have as much extensibility.\\n94: As the machine is running, just a little at a time.\\n95: And at first, it doesn\\'t look it wants to be mixed.\\n96: See how it\\'s just kinda like spinning around now.\\n97: Do not worry.\\n98: We will fix that.\\n99: Okay.\\n100: I\\'m gonna stop that and then pull everything off the hook, and scrape the sides a little bit.\\n101: And the reason why I like to make this bread also, that if you buy this bread, like Asian style bread from an Asian bakery, a lot of times they\\'ll use margarine, and that\\'s not good for you.\\n102: It\\'s so bad for you.\\n103: It\\'s all sorts of trans fats.\\n104: If I make it, I know I\\'m using real butter.\\n105: It taste better, it\\'s better for you.\\n106: It will work itself in, I promise.\\n107: (machine whirring) So that mess of butter eventually, with your patience, absorbs into the bread, and you\\'ve got nice smooth dough.\\n108: So now I\\'ve got a big bowl for my bread to proof in, but I wanna make sure I brush it with oil or melted butter with a mini brush of course.\\n109: I always like to finish final kneading by hand before I let it proof, because, you know, I just feel like it\\'s more evenly kneaded if I do it by hand at the end, and I just love touching dough.\\n110: Like it\\'s just hmm, so soft.\\n111: So now that it\\'s nice and smooth like a baby\\'s bottom, you just let this rest in that bowl that we\\'ve greased.\\n112: And we wanna turn this around to get it completely coated in oil, because as this rise, I wanna put plastic wrap over it.\\n113: If this top part is not greased, it\\'ll stick to the cling film.\\n114: And now this just needs to rest on room temperature for one hour or until it doubles in size.\\n115: If it\\'s really cold where you are, it might take a little longer.\\n116: If you don\\'t have time, you can also let it do a slow cold fermentation in the fridge.\\n117: That means you cover it, put it in the fridge, and then just continue with the recipe over night, so tomorrow, okay?\\n118: Woo!\\n119: Look at this bread.\\n120: So it\\'s been about 15 minutes on my end, because it\\'s really warm in this place.\\n121: I find bread baking just so satisfying.\\n122: You see that and you\\'re like, \"Oh, that worked.\" Okay, so now what you wanna do is take it out and degas it.\\n123: Press all the air out of that.\\n124: So at this point, we\\'re at the shaping stage.\\n125: And you can shape this to whatever shape you want.\\n126: You can do free-form buns, you can put them in loaf pans, you can put them, anything.\\n127: What I\\'m gonna do is I\\'m gonna do pull-apart buns.\\n128: So I\\'ll put buns in a round cake pan, and then when you go to serve it, people can pull apart.\\n129: I just find the pulling apart of buns one of the most satisfying things ever.\\n130: For my eight-inch round cake pan, I can put eight buns in here, and then I\\'ll end up with three buns left over that I will then bake as free-form buns.\\n131: Okay, so you\\'ll just have to work with whatever size pans you\\'ve got.\\n132: So each bun is going to be about 65 grams.\\n133: So I\\'m gonna just weigh each one.\\n134: 67!\\n135: I\\'m good at this.\\n136: All right.\\n137: You wanna form each bun into a bun.\\n138: (laughs) So I\\'m gonna just sort of press everything down, and then gather the edges.\\n139: And then by doing this, what you create is a smooth skin on the other side.\\n140: And then what I do is I grab it with my hand, and I pull it.\\n141: And my pinky is sort of dragging the bottom, and then you get this nice little cute bun.\\n142: Look how cute that is!\\n143: And that\\'s all you do, and then you pop it in your cake pans.\\n144: Yey, and look at my beautiful flower-shaped buns.\\n145: So these will need to proof again.\\n146: This time I find it takes slightly less time, 45 minutes should do it.\\n147: But again, if it\\'s colder it\\'s gonna take a little longer.\\n148: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and I\\'ll see you in a little bit.\\n149: Look at my bread, and it\\'s puffed up.\\n150: It\\'s ready to go into the oven.\\n151: So I\\'m going to stick it in, and then I\\'m gonna just reduce the temperature to 350, and that\\'s gonna bake for...\\n152: The free-form will bake for about 15, and the cake pans will bake for about 20 to 25, and that\\'s it.\\n153: And then you\\'ll have soft, fluffy, white bread.\\n154: Mmm.\\n155: Look at this.\\n156: Look how beautiful these are.\\n157: I\\'m gonna flip it out.\\n158: It\\'s still pretty hot.\\n159: Ahh!\\n160: Ta-dah!\\n161: Whoop!\\n162: I don\\'t like to let it completely cool in the pan, because I find the bottoms are to get soggy.\\n163: Once it\\'s got, like, five minutes flip it out onto a rack and let it cool completely, but I wanna show you this.\\n164: Look at this texture of this bread.\\n165: Oh yeah.\\n166: Look at that.\\n167: Look how soft and fluffy this texture looks.\\n168: I mean you can just tell that\\'s good stuff, right?\\n169: Look at that.\\n170: Smells so good, so buttery.\\n171: It\\'s still warm.\\n172: Oh it\\'s like white bread perfection.\\n173: It\\'s so soft, but at the same time chewy and buttery.\\n174: Just a hint of sweet.\\n175: Two table spoons of sugar will give you a neutral bread that\\'ll work in savory, sort of like as a dinner roll or a sandwich, or as a sweet bread.\\n176: You wanna fill it with something sweet, so good.\\n177: Now, this is actually a really, really good base dough if you wanna start filling it, wrapping it, turning it into all sorts of different cool creations.\\n178: And yes, I will have something coming up, so definitely stay tuned.\\n179: This is super useful dough.\\n180: But seriously, if I just have this, oh, maybe dip it in some condensed milk or dip it in my pandan custard.\\n181: Ah, perfect.\\n182: So the recipe, as always, will be on

information to answer the question.  Output 1 if the question can be answered, output 0 if the question cannot be answered. In case of a 1, also provide the caption numbers that provide the evidence for the answer.\\n\\n### Answer:\\n1, 128-132, 137, 145\\n\\n### Explanation:\\nThe question asks if the bread recipe can be stuffed. The captions provide evidence that the bread can be shaped into pull-apart buns (128-132) and that the buns can be put in round cake pans (131). The questioner also mentions that they like the idea of pull-apart buns (129), which is consistent with the information in the captions. Additionally, the captions mention that there will be three buns left over that can be baked as free-form buns (130), suggesting that the dough can be stuffed into various shapes. The captions also mention that the dough can be used as a base for filling and wrapping to create different creations (178-179), further indicating that the dough can be stuffed. Therefore, the answer is 1 and the evidence is in captions 128-132, 137, 145, and 178-179.</s>',\n",

can put them, anything.\\n127: What I\\'m gonna do is I\\'m gonna do pull-apart buns.\\n128: So I\\'ll put buns in a round cake pan, and then when you go to serve it, people can pull apart.\\n129: I just find the pulling apart of buns one of the most satisfying things ever.\\n130: For my eight-inch round cake pan, I can put eight buns in here, and then I\\'ll end up with three buns left over that I will then bake as free-form buns.\\n131: Okay, so you\\'ll just have to work with whatever size pans you\\'ve got.\\n132: So each bun is going to be about 65 grams.\\n133: So I\\'m gonna just weigh each one.\\n134: 67!\\n135: I\\'m good at this.\\n136: All right.\\n137: You wanna form each bun into a bun.\\n138: (laughs) So I\\'m gonna just sort of press everything down, and then gather the edges.\\n139: And then by doing this, what you create is a smooth skin on the other side.\\n140: And then what I do is I grab it with my hand, and I pull it.\\n141: And my pinky is sort of dragging the bottom, and then you get this nice little cute bun.\\n142: Look how cute that is!\\n143: And that\\'s all you do, and then you pop it in your cake pans.\\n144: Yey, and look at my beautiful flower-shaped buns.\\n145: So these will need to proof again.\\n146: This time I find it takes slightly less time, 45 minutes should do it.\\n147: But again, if it\\'s colder it\\'s gonna take a little longer.\\n148: Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and I\\'ll see you in a little bit.\\n149: Look at my bread, and it\\'s puffed up.\\n150: It\\'s ready to go into the oven.\\n151: So I\\'m going to stick it in, and then I\\'m gonna just reduce the temperature to 350, and that\\'s gonna bake for...\\n152: The free-form will bake for about 15, and the cake pans will bake for about 20 to 25, and that\\'s it.\\n153: And then you\\'ll have soft, fluffy, white bread.\\n154: Mmm.\\n155: Look at this.\\n156: Look how beautiful these are.\\n157: I\\'m gonna flip it out.\\n158: It\\'s still pretty hot.\\n159: Ahh!\\n160: Ta-dah!\\n161: Whoop!\\n162: I don\\'t like to let it completely cool in the pan, because I find the bottoms are to get soggy.\\n163: Once it\\'s got, like, five minutes flip it out onto a rack and let it cool completely, but I wanna show you this.\\n164: Look at this texture of this bread.\\n165: Oh yeah.\\n166: Look at that.\\n167: Look how soft and fluffy this texture looks.\\n168: I mean you can just tell that\\'s good stuff, right?\\n169: Look at that.\\n170: Smells so good, so buttery.\\n171: It\\'s still warm.\\n172: Oh it\\'s like white bread perfection.\\n173: It\\'s so soft, but at the same time chewy and buttery.\\n174: Just a hint of sweet.\\n175: Two table spoons of sugar will give you a neutral bread that\\'ll work in savory, sort of like as a dinner roll or a sandwich, or as a sweet bread.\\n176: You wanna fill it with something sweet, so good.\\n177: Now, this is actually a really, really good base dough if you wanna start filling it, wrapping it, turning it into all sorts of different cool creations.\\n178: And yes, I will have something coming up, so definitely stay tuned.\\n179: This is super useful dough.\\n180: But seriously, if I just have this, oh, maybe dip it in some condensed milk or dip it in my pandan custard.\\n181: Ah, perfect.\\n182: So the recipe, as always, will be on PaisKitchen.com.\\n183: When you make it, send me a photo on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.\\n184: If you haven\\'t subscribed to the channel, make sure you do, so you don\\'t miss an

      "19: in order to get the part out, we have to take out this control panel section.\n",
      "20: tell them: buy four screws and we have to take this trim off the front to get the other two off their quarter-inch screws.\n",
      "21: so we'll do the back to first.\n",
      "22: all right.\n",
      "23: next thing you have to do is take a small screwdriver and pop these knobs out and then we can go ahead and get behind this front trim and pop it off.\n",
      "24: be very careful you're taking it off.\n",
      "25: you don't want to break it.\n",
      "26: another way of the front panel off, we can take out these two screws to get access to inside.\n",
      "27: now that we have the four screws out, we have access to all the parts inside.\n",
      "28: now that we have the control panel taken apart, we have access to the control.\n",
      "29: we have to take the screws out that hold this bracket in place so we can lift it up, so we can actually get to these quarter-inch screws that hold the control in place.\n",
      "30: so we're going to take these two screws out and remove the control.\n",
      "31: all right.\n",
      "32: in order to get the control out, first thing we're going to do is remove the wires.\n",
      "33: got the double black on top and the orange on the bottom.\n",
      "34: you can use a small screwdriver to get these off if they're tight- and then the ground wire- all right.\n",
      "35: since we took the screws out on the bottom, we can now lift this control up a little bit so we can get the screws out- quarter-inch screws.\n",
      "36: in order to remove the control, we have to remove this capillary tube that goes back through this little clip right here.\n",
      "37: so all you have to do is kind of pull up against it and it will just come through.\n",
      "38: in order to remove the cold control, we have to remove the capillary tube from.\n",
      "39: these little clips should just pop out, and then we can pull the capillary tube up through the control.\n",
      "40: here's the old thermostat next to the new thermostat.\n",
      "41: if you already have one of these, great.\n",
      "42: if not, you can get it out.\n",
      "43: appliance parts pros, comm.\n",
      "44: the only thing we have to do is take this plastic sleeve off the old capillary and put it onto the new one.\n",
      "45: so we're going to make sure we straighten the capillary up- really good- and pull it off.\n",
      "46: once you have it off, we can go ahead and put it onto the new one.\n",
      "47: the new capillary comes all coiled up, so you have to straighten it out.\n",
      "48: you want to be very careful that you don't kink this capillary.\n",
      "49: it is a hollow tube and if you can't get or damage it, it's not going to give you the proper temperature.\n",
      "50: alright, once you have it pretty straight, we're going to take the plastic tubing and just feed it back up the capillary again, be very careful that you don't kink this tubing, though, as you'll be buying another one.\n",
      "51: you want to slide it on there.\n",
      "52: so the tip of the capillary is right at the very end.\n",
      "53: if you stretch the plastic out while you were pulling it out and you have a little bit of extra, you can trim it off.\n",
      "54: so it's right at the end of the capillary tube.\n",
      "55: now that we have that installed onto the new one, we can go ahead and put the control back into the refrigerator.\n",
      "56: it's going to mount right here, and then we have to run the capillary tube through there.\n",
      "57: so we're going to stick this tube in and kind of reach from behind and guide it through.\n",
      "58: all right, when you're remounting the thermostat, make sure that you put the bracket behind the thermostat mounting ears.\n",
      "59: this screw is actually going to the sheet metal, not the actual control.\n",
      "60: all right, now that we have the control remounted, we can remount this bracket.\n",
      "61: when you put it back down, make sure that this cam goes in that little notch right there so it can control your freezer temperature.\n",
      "62: and to put that back in, it was the Philips screws from underneath.\n",
      "63: all right, now that we have everything remounted, we can reconnect the wires.\n",
      "64: we got the grounding wire, the orange was on the bottom and the double block was on top.\n",
      "65: we're going to put this up and out of the way so we can show you how to put a capillary tube on without this thing hanging in a way, and then we'll finish putting this together in a minute to do with the big washers go.\n",
      "66: in order to finish installing the capillary tube, we have to make sure that we bring it over the top, bring it around and through the clips to mount it.\n",
      "67: so all we have to do stretch it over the back and then get it into these little clips to mount it again and then click in the top bar.\n",
      "68: all right, that's it.\n",
      "69: we have the capillary tube installed.\n",
      "70: it's not interfering with the damper control.\n",
      "71: now that we have everything reinstalled, we can put the covers back on, make sure this little tab goes up in the slot.\n",
      "72: the front half is held on by your Philips screw.\n",
      "73: second cover goes on the same way.\n",
      "74: what you do is put it up there and put screw back in and then we can put the control panel back on.\n",
      "75: it hooks in on the bottom.\n",
      "76: these grooves right here go right in, get these slots and then you push it up and snap it into place.\n",
      "77: all right, the last thing we have to put on is the control knobs.\n",
      "78: remember the one with the funky back is the refrigerator control.\n",
      "79: on the top is the narrow part and on the bottom is the wide part.\n",
      "80: so we're going to make sure this narrow part goes towards the top and the wide part is towards the bottom.\n",
      "81: wherever your control happens to be lined up.\n",
      "82: it may be a little bit different, but you just have to look in there to see.\n",
      "83: and then on the freezer control, just a d-shaped knob.\n",
      "84: so we're going to get the flat right there and match up the flat and put it in.\n"

If it is answerable, identify the captions that provide evidence for answering the question.\\n\\n### Question:\\nwhere is a list of the amounts of ingredients.  i would like to make them but i do not want to guess\\n\\n### Captions (ID, Caption)):\\n0: Hey Good morning Everybody today!\\n1: I'm going to show you how to make a holiday treat that is a favorite for a lot of people and these features ridiculously easy to make and you don't have to bake them which is really nice for a change and it only takes a few ingredients.\\n2: Okay, so we're gonna be making rum balls today and yes, I am using real rum for this and if you want to use the extract now I don't know how much you need.\\n3: Basically what you'd have to do is just add some and you know, adjust it to taste.\\n4: but the first thing to do is get your sweet condensed milk in a big bowl and combine it with the rum.\\n5: I Always keep this stuff at room temperature because it's really hard to get out of the can if you have it in the refrigerator.\\n6: so measure the rum quarter cup and mix that in.\\n7: Just let's not sit, add the gram crumbs and the cocoa now.\\n8: I Always use a spoon and measure the cocoa directly over the container to try to minimize the mess because powdered cocoa can make quite a mess.\\n9: especially if you some recipes tell you've got to sift the cocoa.\\n10: I find that if you add it to the crumbs and just work it with a spatula for a little bit, all the lumps come out pretty fast.\\n11: So after that mix down I cut off the top of the pack or coconut and basically just grab half of it.\\n12: You don't even need to measure it because you're going to be using half for the ingredient and half to coat it in after.\\n13: So just kind of pinch the package there like that and just set this on the side for later, fold it over, gently, mix it on the coconut to the crumbs.\\n14: So now let's check on the wet ingredients.\\n15: Yeah, you can see just in that little bit of time.\\n16: the rhombus worked all the way through, so just add I put in about half of the dry.\\n17: get that mixed in fast.\\n18: It just makes it easier than doing all the dry at once.\\n19: Now you can just put the rest in all at once.\\n20: Now you do want to let this rest a bit just for the time it's going to take for the wet ingredients to soak into the crumbs and it will thicken up a bit because you want this thick enough to be able to form the balls.\\n21: and right now you I'm just gonna transfer this to another Bowl and just pop this in the fridge for a bit so it's easier to work with.\\n22: I Had to go out for a while.\\n23: These have been in the fridge for a few hours, which is fine because they set up real nice.\\n24: Now there's a couple ways you can do this.\\n25: I've got a spoon here to make these of course.\\n26: make sure you wash your hands well before you start and what I do is I put some coconut on a plate I leave a bit in in case it gets a bit mucky and one plate to roll in one plate to put them on.\\n27: so just scoop some up with a spoon to decide how much you want in each run ball and basically just rolling between your hands till you've got sort of a ball shape which is good enough.\\n28: Drop it in the coconut, just kind of move it around till it's coated and just put them on the plate and just keep going on.\\n29: Yeah, one tip, if you get tired of doing them one by one, you can just roll up a few and just drop them in the coconut and then roll them one by one.\\n30: As you want though, there are the rum balls all finished.\\n31: As you can see, it makes about two dozen good-sized ones give or take one or two for taste testing of course.\\n32: I hope you try these and I hope you like them.\\n33: Thanks for watching I'll see you again.\\n\\n### Instructions:\\nDetermine if the above captions provide enough information to answer the question.  Output 1 if the question can be answered, output 0 if the question cannot be answered.  If the question can be answered, provide the captions that provide the evidence for the answer.\\n\\n### Answer:\\n0. The captions do not provide a list of the amounts of ingredients. They mention some ingredients and give instructions on how to combine them, but they do not specify exact measurements for all ingredients.\\n\\n### Explanation:\\nThe captions mention that the recipe requires sweet condensed milk, rum, gram crumbs, cocoa, and coconut. They also give instructions on how to combine these ingredients, but they do not provide exact measurements for all of them. For example, they mention adding a quarter cup of rum to the sweet condensed milk, but they do not specify how much sweet condensed milk should be used. Similarly, they mention adding cocoa to the gram crumbs, but they do not specify how much cocoa should be used. Therefore, the captions do not provide enough information to answer the question.</s>\""
