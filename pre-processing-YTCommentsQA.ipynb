      "Hey Good morning Everybody today! I'm going to show you how to make a holiday treat that is a favorite for a lot of people and these features ridiculously easy to make and you don't have to bake them which is really nice for a change and it only takes a few ingredients. Okay, so we're gonna be making rum balls today and yes, I am using real rum for this and if you want to use the extract now I don't know how much you need. Basically what you'd have to do is just add some and you know, adjust it to taste. but the first thing to do is get your sweet condensed milk in a big bowl and combine it with the rum. I Always keep this stuff at room temperature because it's really hard to get out of the can if you have it in the refrigerator. so measure the rum quarter cup and mix that in. Just let's not sit, add the gram crumbs and the cocoa now. I Always use a spoon and measure the cocoa directly over the container to try to minimize the mess because powdered cocoa can make quite a mess. especially if you some recipes tell you've got to sift the cocoa. I find that if you add it to the crumbs and just work it with a spatula for a little bit, all the lumps come out pretty fast. So after that mix down I cut off the top of the pack or coconut and basically just grab half of it. You don't even need to measure it because you're going to be using half for the ingredient and half to coat it in after. So just kind of pinch the package there like that and just set this on the side for later, fold it over, gently, mix it on the coconut to the crumbs. So now let's check on the wet ingredients. Yeah, you can see just in that little bit of time. the rhombus worked all the way through, so just add I put in about half of the dry. get that mixed in fast. It just makes it easier than doing all the dry at once. Now you can just put the rest in all at once. Now you do want to let this rest a bit just for the time it's going to take for the wet ingredients to soak into the crumbs and it will thicken up a bit because you want this thick enough to be able to form the balls. and right now you I'm just gonna transfer this to another Bowl and just pop this in the fridge for a bit so it's easier to work with. I Had to go out for a while. These have been in the fridge for a few hours, which is fine because they set up real nice. Now there's a couple ways you can do this. I've got a spoon here to make these of course. make sure you wash your hands well before you start and what I do is I put some coconut on a plate I leave a bit in in case it gets a bit mucky and one plate to roll in one plate to put them on. so just scoop some up with a spoon to decide how much you want in each run ball and basically just rolling between your hands till you've got sort of a ball shape which is good enough. Drop it in the coconut, just kind of move it around till it's coated and just put them on the plate and just keep going on. Yeah, one tip, if you get tired of doing them one by one, you can just roll up a few and just drop them in the coconut and then roll them one by one. As you want though, there are the rum balls all finished. As you can see, it makes about two dozen good-sized ones give or take one or two for taste testing of course. I hope you try these and I hope you like them. Thanks for watching I'll see you again.\n"
